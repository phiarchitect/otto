# WIPER & WASHER

---

The small blades for the headlight wipers found on some models are removed in the same fashion as the windshield wiper blades. Pull the wiper away from the light, lift the pivot cover,
remove the nut, then remove the blade and arm. It is necessary to disconnect the washer tube from the blade assembly when removing the arm.
During installation, place the wiper blade below the park stop on the light. Tighten the retaining nut and reposition the blade above the stop. The blade should rest firmly on the stop. Don't
forget to reattach the washer line.
