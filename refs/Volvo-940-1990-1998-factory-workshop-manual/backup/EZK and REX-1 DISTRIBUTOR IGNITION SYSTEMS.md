# EZK and REX 1 DISTRIBUTOR IGNITION SYSTEMS

---

Ignition system functions are controlled by the control module, so no adjustment is necessary. To check or adjust the ignition timing, refer to Section 1 of this manual.

---

The Camshaft position sensor is covered in Section 4, under Electronic Engine Controls.

---

The Crankshaft position sensor is covered in Section 4, under Electronic Engine Controls.

---

The best way to perform this procedure is to use a spark tester (available at most automotive parts stores). Two types of spark testers are commonly available. The Neon Bulb type is
connected to the spark plug wire and flashes with each ignition pulse. The Air Gap type must be adjusted to the individual spark plug gap specified for the engine. This type of tester allows
the user to not only detect the presence of spark, but also the intensity (orange/yellow is weak, blue is strong).
1.

Disconnect a spark plug wire at the spark plug end.

2.

Connect the plug wire to the spark tester and ground the tester to an appropriate location on the engine.

3.

Crank the engine and check for spark at the tester.

4.

If spark exists at the tester, the ignition system is functioning properly.

5.

If spark does not exist at the spark plug wire, remove the distributor cap and ensure that the rotor is turning when the engine is cranked.

6.

If the rotor is turning, perform the spark test again using the ignition coil wire.

7.

If spark does not exist at the ignition coil wire, test the ignition coil, and other distributor related components or wiring. Repair or replace components as necessary.

Fig. 1: Take care in working around the ignition system; high
voltage is present and electrical shock can occur

The ignition system operates with a very high output and there are hazardous voltages in the low and high voltage circuits.
Always turn the ignition OFF, before separating connectors.
Before detaching the control unit connector, remove fuse 1 (740/940 models) or fuse 31 (760 models) to deactivate the ignition system.
Never disconnect the battery while the engine is running.
Always disconnect the battery when quick charging the battery.
Never use a boost charger or voltage higher than 16 volts to start the engine.
Always remove the control unit if the vehicle is to be stove or if welding is to be carried out. The control unit must not be exposed to temperatures above 176°F (80°C).
Do not replace a control unit without first correcting the original fault, or the same fault may damage the new control unit.
Do not be hasty in condemning the ECM. This system uses voltages and resistances that are very small. Examine the sensors, wiring and connectors carefully. The sensors operate
in more harsh conditions than the ECM which is generally in a more protected location.
Check all ground connections before condemning the ECM.
Use care when working around vehicles equipped with Supplementary Restraint System (SRS), often known as "air bags." Vehicles equipped with SRS are generally recognized by
the letters SRS molded into the steering wheel cover. Follow all precautions to avoid personal injury.
A spare location in the fuse panel is used as a test terminal for SRS diagnostics. Never install a fuse in this position or connect accessories to this terminal.
Before performing any component testing, check for and, if necessary, repair the following:
Damaged, corroded, contaminated, carbon tracked or worn distributor cap and rotor
Damaged, fouled, improperly seated or gapped spark plug(s)
Damaged or improperly engaged electrical connections, spark plug wires, etc.
Discharged battery
Blown fuses

---

The only function of the distributor is to distribute voltage to the spark plugs. There are no advance functions built into the distributor. It is no longer possible to adjust ignition timing through the
distributor.

NOTE: For information on understanding electricity and troubleshooting electrical circuits, please refer to Section 6 of this manual.
The EZ115K, EZ116K, EZ129K, and REX-1 ignition systems, used on Coupe, 240, 700 series, 1993–94 850, and 940 models are like most engine management systems currently in use,
in that ignition functions are closely integrated with the fuel system. Various sensors feed information to an on-board computer which makes necessary adjustments.
The EZK ignition systems are used on vehicles utilizing Bosch LH-Jetronic electronic engine controls. The REX-1 system is used on vehicles with the Bendix Regina electronic engine control
system. Both systems have separate control modules for the ignition and engine controls. The inputs are similar on both; knock sensor, crankshaft position sensor, engine coolant
temperature sensor, throttle position sensor or switch, and inputs from the electronic engine control module.

PRIMARY WINDING TEST

1.

Disconnect the negative battery cable.

2.

Remove fuse No. 1 (740 and 940 models) or fuse No. 31 (model 760) from the fuse box. Note that these fuses must be removed whenever any connector to or from the ECU is
removed or installed.

3.

4.

Remove the connector from the power stage.

5.

Remove the rubber cover from the connector to expose the terminals. Never test the terminals from the front. This could result in damage to the terminals and make any faults
worse.

6.

Connect an ohmmeter between the power stage amplifier connector terminal 1 and terminal 15 of the ignition coil. Resistance should be 0.6–1.0 ohms.

7.

If resistance is low, replace the ignition coil.

8.

If resistance is too high, connect an ohmmeter directly to terminals 1 and 15 of the ignition coil. If resistance is still too high, replace the ignition coil.

9.

If resistance is correct (0.6–1.0 ohm), check the wire between the ignition coil and power stage amplifier connector terminal 1. Replace/repair the wire as needed.

10.

Install the air cleaner assembly.

11.

REX-1 System
NOTE: To check the ignition coil/power stage unit on REX-1 systems, make sure the ignition switch is OFF.
1.

Remove the air cleaner assembly.

2.

Unplug the connectors from the coil/power stage unit.

3.

Remove the ignition coil from the power stage by removing the 2 Torx® head screws and lifting off the ignition coil.

4.

Measure the resistance between the terminals of the ignition coil by connecting an ohmmeter between the low voltage terminals ( + ) and ( -). Resistance should be 0.5 ohms.

5.

Connect an ohmmeter between the high tension terminal and a low voltage terminal. Resistance should be approximately 5000 ohms.

6.

Check that voltage is present at the ignition coil/power stage unit by first turning the ignition ON. Connect a voltmeter between ground and terminal A in the 3-way connector.
There should be 12 volts. If the voltage is low, or none at all, check the point where the feed wire branches to the ECU and ignition coil/power stage unit.

7.

Check that the voltage does not fall below 10.5 volts when the starter motor is operated.

8.

Turn the ignition key OFF.

9.

Check the ground connections of the ignition coil/power stage unit by connecting an ohmmeter between ground and terminal B of the 3-way connector. The resistance should not
exceed 0.1 ohm. If the resistance is too high, check for bad ground connection.

10.

Connect an ohmmeter between ground and terminal A of the 2-way connector. If resistance is more than 0.1 ohm, check for a bad ground connection.

11.

Check the signal line between the ignition coil/power stage unit and ECU. Check for power on this circuit. Connecting a shop-made buzzer between terminal B of the 2-way
connector and terminal 16 of the ECU may be helpful. If the line is problem-free, the buzzer should sound.

12.

Install the air cleaner assembly.
