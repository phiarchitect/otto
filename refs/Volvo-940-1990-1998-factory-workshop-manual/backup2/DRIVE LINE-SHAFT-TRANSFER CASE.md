## Driveshaft Components and Operation


The driveshaft is a two-piece tubular unit, connected by an intermediate universal joint. The rear end of the front section of the driveshaft contains a splined sleeve. A splined shaft forming
one of the yokes for the intermediate U-joint fits into this sleeve.
The front section is supported by a bearing contained in an insulated rubber housing attached to the bottom of the driveshaft tunnel. The front section is connected to the transmission flange,
and the rear section is connected to the differential housing flange by universal joints.
Each joint consists of a spider with 4 ground trunnions in the flange yokes surrounded by needle bearings.

universal joints

## Driveshaft Balancing: Best Left to Professionals


Driveshaft balancing is a process best left for a professional with the proper equipment. Makeshift methods using hose clamps or similar devices can work, but the process of correcting
the imbalance in this manner is very tough and extremely time consuming.
Many machine shops can balance driveshafts; some parts stores and jobbers can also balance driveshafts using outside contractors.

## Removing and Cleaning Driveshaft Assembly


1.

Remove the driveshaft and universal joint assembly as previously outlined.

2.

Clean off the dirt from the surrounding area and remove the snaprings, which secure the needle bearings in the yokes, with a snapring pliers. If the rings are difficult to loosen,
apply rust penetrant and tap the ring lightly with a hammer and punch.

3.

Lightly mount the shaft in a vise and adjust its position so that the yoke is supported by the jaws. If at all possible, do not tighten the vise onto the tubular shaft; it can be easily
deformed.

4.

Using a plastic mallet, tap on the shaft flange until the bearing cup(s) protrude about 0.2 inch (5mm). Do not tap on the tubular shaft.

5.

Leaving the flange clamped in the vise, lift the driveshaft and insert a piece of wood or a hammer handle under the shaft. Gently press down on the driveshaft; this will lever the
bearing cap upwards. Once all are removed, clean the seats in the driveshaft and flange. Clean the spider and needle bearings completely. Check the contact surfaces for wear.
Replace any worn or broken parts. If the old needle bearings and spider are to be reused, fill them with molybdenum disulfide chassis grease, and make sure that the rubber
seals are not damaged. If new needle bearings are used, fill them half-way with the grease.

6.

Remove the bearing caps and seals from the new spider. Make sure that the needle bearings and seals are in place within the cups.

7.

Position the spider into the flange yoke. Place one of the bearing cups on the spider and tap the cup until it is firmly seated.

8.

Using the vise and a sleeve of proper size, press the cup into place in the yoke. The cup should project through the yoke about 0.1–0.2 inch (2.5–5.0mm). Install the snapring
(circlip). Make sure the spider is centered within the yoke.

9.

Repeat the previous pressing operation on the opposite side of the flange yoke. Note that when the second bearing cup is pressed into place, the first bearing cup is pressed
against its snapring.

10.

Fit the spider into the driveshaft yoke. Place and press each bearing cup into place following the procedures above.

11.

Release the assembly from the vise. Check the new joint for free motion in all dimensions. If any stiffness or binding is present, remount the assembly in the vise (as described
previously) and LIGHTLY tap the spider ends with a plastic mallet.
