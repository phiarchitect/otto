# FRONT SUSPENSION

## "Coil Spring Integration and MacPherson Strut Procedures"


The coil springs are integrated into the strut assembly. See the MacPherson Strut removal and installation and overhaul procedures which follow.

## Control Arm Strut and Bushing Inspection and Replacement


The control arm strut, also called the radius rod or strut rod, serve to locate the lower control arm and prevent fore-and-aft movement. Except for impact damage, the rods rarely fail. The
rubber bushings on each end are prone to fatigue and wear, and may need to be replaced after a few years. This part is found on all 960/S90/V90 models.

## Front Suspension Removal and Installation Procedure


1.

Disconnect the negative battery cable.

2.

Raise and safely support the vehicle on jackstands.

3.

Loosen the rod-to-bracket bolt but don't remove it.

4.

Remove the nut at the control arm. This is sometimes easier said than done; the control arm bolt can be very tight.

5.

Once the front nut is loosened, the back mount may be removed and the rod placed on a workbench.

6.

If the bushings are to be replaced, press them free of their mounts and install the new ones.

7.

Reinstall the rod, attaching the bracket bolt first.

8.

Make sure the front bushings seat properly in the control arm and that the front nut draws tight against its washer.

9.

Tighten the bracket bolt to 63 ft. lbs. (85 Nm).

To install:

10.

Tighten the control arm nut to 70 ft. lbs. (95 Nm).

11.

Lower the vehicle.

12.

Connect the negative battery cable.

## Front Wheel Bearing Maintenance for Front Drive Vehicles


850, S70, C70 and V70 Models
The front wheel bearings are not adjustable on front drive vehicles. If the lateral run-out on the hub with the disc removed exceeds 0.0007 inch (0.020mm), the hub must be replaced.

## Front Suspension: MacPherson Type with Independent Wheel Suspension


The front suspension is the MacPherson type, which means that the wheels are independently sprung. The spring is located around the strut assembly, the lower end of which is affixed to
the wheel spindle. The strut assembly is retained by a threaded screw in an upper mount, which is fixed to the wheel housing, and by its seating at the bottom. The upper end of the spring
is fixed to the wheel arch and rests on the upper mount, through the upper mount seat. The seating for the lower end of the spring is a welded perch on the bottom of the strut tube.

## Front Wheel Bearing Replacement for Rear Drive Vehicles


Except 850, C70, S70 and V70
The front wheel bearings are not adjustable on the rear drive vehicles. If the lateral run-out on the hub with the disc removed exceeds 0.0012 inch (0.030mm), the hub must be replaced.

## Wheel Bearing Inspection and Maintenance


To check wheel bearing play, raise the vehicle and support it safely. Rock the wheel at 12 and 6 o'clock position. If there is movement, the wheel bearing should be serviced.
To check wheel bearing noise, raise the wheel off the ground, then spin the wheel by hand and let it rotate freely after spinning. Check for wheel bearing noise. If the wheel bearing remains
noisy after proper adjustment, replace the wheel bearing.

## Front Suspension: Wheel Bearing Replacement Procedure


Except 850, C70, S70 and V70

1.

Raise and support the vehicle safely.

Remove the hub and brake disc assembly. Use a bearing puller to remove the inner bearing if it stays on the spindle.
NOTE: If the vehicle is equipped with separate brake disc and hub, the guide pin and brake disc must be removed from the hub prior to bearing
replacement.

7.

Use a brass drift and carefully tap out the grease seal and inner bearing race.

8.

Remove the outer bearing race, using a suitable handle and drift.

9.

Press in a new inner bearing race, using a suitable handle and drift.

10.

Press in a new outer bearing race, using a suitable handle and drift.

11.

Pack the wheel bearing between the cage and inner race with as much grease as possible. Also smear grease on the outer side of the bearing and bearing races inside the hub.
Fill the space in the hub with grease to a diameter of the smallest ball races.

12.

On hubs with integrated brake disc, position the inner bearing seal in the hub and press the seal in so the edge lies in the same plane as the hub.

13.

On hub with separate hub and brake disc:

To install:

A.

Press the sealing ring onto the spindle, making sure that the seal ring is square. The sealing ring lip should face outwards.

B.

Install the inner bearing in the hub. Press in the sealing washer.

14.

Install the hub, outer race and castle nut.

15.

To adjust the bearing pre-load:

NOTE: On vehicles with separate hub and brake disc, install the brake disc and guide pin.

A.

Spin the hub and simultaneously tighten the center nut to 42 ft. lbs. (57 Nm).

B.

Loosen the nut 1 ⁄ 2 turn, then tighten the nut by hand, approximately 12 inch lbs. (1.4 Nm).

C.

Install the cotter pin. If the pin hole in the spindle does not align with the pin hole in the nut, unscrew the nut slightly to the nearest pin hole.

D.

Install the protective cap.

16.

Install the brake caliper.

17.

Install the wheel.

## Maintaining and Upgrading the Sway Bar and Bushings


The sway bar, variously called the anti-roll bar or stabilizer bar, serves to control the sideways roll of the body during cornering. While the bar itself rarely fails, the links and bushings around
it are prone to wear. If the bar is not rigidly mounted to the vehicle, it cannot do its job properly.
Sway bars of different diameters (thickness) can stiffen or soften the roll characteristics of a vehicle. Bushings are easily replaced and well worth the effort in terms of restoring proper
cornering manners to your vehicle.

## Front Suspension Removal and Installation Procedure

## Front Suspension Alignment and Handling


If the tires are worn unevenly, if the vehicle is not stable on the highway or if the handling seems uneven in spirited driving, the wheel alignment should be checked. If an alignment problem
is suspected, first check for improper tire inflation and other possible causes. These can be worn suspension or steering components, accident damage or even unmatched tires. If any
worn or damaged components are found, they must be replaced before the wheels can be properly aligned. Wheel alignment requires very expensive equipment and involves minute
adjustments which must be accurate; it should only be performed by a trained technician. Take your vehicle to a properly equipped shop.
Following is a description of the alignment angles which are adjustable on most vehicles and how they affect vehicle handling. Although these angles can apply to both the front and rear
wheels, usually only the front suspension is adjustable.

## Understanding Camber and Its Effects on Tire Contact and Vehicle Stability


Looking from the front of the vehicle, camber is the inward or outward tilt of the top of wheels. When the tops of the wheels are tilted in, this is negative camber; if they are tilted out, it is
positive. In a turn, a slight amount of negative camber helps maximize contact of the tire with the road. However, too much negative camber compromises straight-line stability, increases
bump steer and torque steer.

## Understanding Caster Angle and its Impact on Steering Stability


Looking at a vehicle from the side, caster angle describes the steering axis rather than a wheel angle. The steering knuckle is attached to a control arm or strut at the top and a control arm
at the bottom. The wheel pivots around the line between these points to steer the vehicle. When the upper point is tilted back, this is described as positive caster. Having a positive caster
tends to make the wheels self-centering, increasing directional stability. Excessive positive caster makes the wheels hard to steer, while an uneven caster will cause a pull to one side.
Overloading the vehicle or sagging rear springs will affect caster, as will raising the rear of the vehicle. If the rear of the vehicle is lower than normal, the caster becomes more positive.

used on shopping carts, for example, employ positive caster
