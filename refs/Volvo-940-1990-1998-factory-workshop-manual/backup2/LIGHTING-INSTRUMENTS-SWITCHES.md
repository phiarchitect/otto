# LIGHTING INSTRUMENTS SWITCHES

## Adjusting and Testing Light Beam Alignment


1.

Park the vehicle on level ground, so it is perpendicular to and, facing a flat wall about 25 ft. (7.6m) away.

2.

Remove any stone shields, if equipped, and switch ON the lights.

3.

Loosen the mounting hardware of the lights so you can aim them as follows:
A.

The horizontal distance between the light beams on the wall should be the same as between the lights themselves.

B.

The vertical height of the light beams above the ground should be 4 in. (10cm) less than the distance between the ground and the center of the lamp lenses for fog
lights. For driving lights, the vertical height should be even with the distance between the ground and the center of the lamp.

4.

Tighten the mounting hardware.

5.

Test to make sure the lights work correctly, and the light pattern is even.

## Installation of Aftermarket Lights for Road Use


NOTE: Before installing any aftermarket light, make sure it is legal for road use. Most acceptable lights will have a DOT approval number. Also check your local and
regional inspection regulations. In certain areas, aftermarket lights must be installed in a particular manner or they may not be legal for inspection.
1.

Disconnect the negative battery cable.

2.

Unpack the contents of the light kit purchased. Place the contents in an open space where you can easily retrieve a piece if needed.

3.

Choose a location for the lights. If you are installing fog lights, below the bumper and apart from each other is desirable. Most fog lights are mounted below or very close to the
headlights. If you are installing driving lights, above the bumper and close together is desirable. Most driving lights are mounted between the headlights.

4.

Drill the needed hole(s) to mount the light. Install the light, and secure using the supplied retainer nut and washer. Tighten the light mounting hardware, but not the light adjustment
nut or bolt.

5.

Install the relay that came with the light kit in the engine compartment, in a rigid area, such as a fender. Always install the relay with the terminals facing down. This will prevent
water from entering the relay assembly.

6.

Using the wire supplied, locate the ground terminal on the relay, and connect a length of wire from this terminal to a good ground source. You can drill a hole and screw this wire to
an inside piece of metal; just scrape the paint away from the hole to ensure a good connection.

7.

Locate the light terminal on the relay; and attach a length of wire between this terminal and the fog/driving lamps.

8.

Locate the ignition terminal on the relay, and connect a length of wire between this terminal and the light switch.

9.

Find a suitable mounting location for the light switch and install. Some examples of mounting areas are a location close to the main light switch, auxiliary light position in the dash
panel, if equipped, or in the center of the dash panel.

10.

Depending on local and regional regulations, the other end of the switch can be connected to a constant power source such as the battery, an ignition opening in the fuse panel, or
a parking or headlight wire.

11.

Locate the power terminal on the relay, and connect a wire with an in-line fuse of at least 10 amperes between the terminal and the battery.

12.

With all the wires connected and tied up neatly, connect the negative battery cable.

13.

Turn the lights ON and adjust the light pattern, if necessary.

ease the installation of driving lights

## Fog Lamp Bulb Replacement Procedure


1.

Remove the fog lamp lens using a small prytool.

2.

Remove the light bulb from the fog light housing by twisting it counterclockwise until it is disengaged, then pull it out of the housing.

3.

Insert the new bulb into the light housing and twist it clockwise to lock it in place.

4.

Install the lens onto the fog lamp assembly by snapping it into place.

5.

Test the lights for proper operation. If the bulb does not function properly, determine the source of the problem (defective bulb, dirty socket, faulty wiring, blown fuse, etc.) and
correct the situation.

## Replacement and Diagnosis of Gauges in the Instrument Cluster


The gauges can be replaced individually on some models, but others require replacement of the entire gauge cluster assembly. The instrument cluster contains many components; inside
the cluster are modules, printed circuit boards, fuses, and some also contain small microprocessor computers for the clock and driver information center. Diagnosis of this system is
complex, and the cost of parts is high; since most parts are special order only, trial and error replacement is just not practical. It is advised to diagnose the failed component before
replacement.
On models where the gauges can be replaced, simply remove the instrument cluster as outlined in this section, and remove the cluster cover. Remove the retaining devices (some use
bolts, some are held in by tabs, etc.) and remove the gauge from the cluster. To install, reverse this procedure.
On models where the cluster must be replaced, remove the instrument cluster as outlined previously in this section. Remove the printed circuit board and any components necessary to
remove the board, then remove the cluster cover. Unfasten the instrument cluster retainers and remove the gauge cluster assembly.
When replacing a speedometer or odometer assembly, or the instrument cluster, federal law requires the odometer reading of the replacement unit to be set to register the same mileage as
the prior odometer. If the mileage cannot be set, the law requires that the replacement be set at zero and a proper label be installed on the driver's door frame to show the previous odometer
reading and date of replacement.

and the retaining screws

## Proper Headlight Aim and Adjustment


The headlights must be properly aimed to provide the best, safest road illumination. The lights should be checked for proper aim and adjusted as necessary. Certain state and local
authorities have requirements for headlight aiming; these should be checked before adjustment is made.
CAUTION
About once a year, when the headlights are replaced or any time front end work is performed on your vehicle, the headlight should be accurately aimed by a reputable repair shop using the
proper equipment. Headlights not properly aimed can make it virtually impossible to see and may blind other drivers on the road, possibly causing an accident. Note that the following
procedure is a temporary fix, until you can take your vehicle to a repair shop for a proper adjustment.
Headlight adjustment may be temporarily made using a wall, as described below, or on the rear of another vehicle. When adjusted, the lights should not glare in oncoming car or truck
windshields, nor should they illuminate the passenger compartment of vehicles driving in front of you. These adjustments are rough and should always be fine-tuned by a repair shop which
is equipped with headlight aiming tools. Improper adjustments may be both dangerous and illegal.
For most of the vehicles covered by this manual, horizontal and vertical aiming of each sealed beam unit is provided by two adjusting screws which move the retaining ring and adjusting
plate against the tension of a coil spring. There is no adjustment for focus; this is done during headlight manufacturing.
NOTE: Because the composite headlight assembly is bolted into position, no adjustment should be necessary or possible. Some applications, however, may be bolted
to an adjuster plate or may be retained by adjusting screws. If so, follow this procedure when adjusting the lights, BUT always have the adjustment checked by a
reputable shop.
Before removing the headlight bulb or disturbing the headlamp in any way, note the current settings in order to ease headlight adjustment upon reassembly. If the high or low beam setting of
the old lamp still works, this can be done using the wall of a garage or a building:

1.

Park the vehicle on a level surface, with the fuel tank about 1 ⁄ 2 full and with the vehicle empty of all extra cargo (unless normally carried). The vehicle should be facing a wall
which is no less than 6 feet (1.8m) high and 12 feet (3.7m) wide. The front of the vehicle should be about 25 feet (7.6m) from the wall.
Fig. 1: The headlight aiming levels, as viewed from the top

Fig. 2: Location of the aiming screws on most vehicles with
sealed beam headlights

Fig. 3: Example of headlight adjustment screw location for
composite headlamps

2.

If aiming is to be performed outdoors, it is advisable to wait until dusk in order to properly see the headlight beams on the wall. If done in a garage, darken the area around the
wall as much as possible by closing shades or hanging cloth over the windows.

3.

Turn the headlights ON and mark the wall at the center of each light's low beam, then switch on the high beams and mark the center of each light's high beam. A short length of
masking tape which is visible from the front of the vehicle may be used. Although marking all four positions is advisable, marking one position from each light should be sufficient.
Fig. 4: Low beam headlight pattern alignment

Fig. 5: High beam headlight pattern alignment

4.

If neither beam on one side is working, and if another like-sized vehicle is available, park the second one in the exact spot where the vehicle was and mark the beams using the
same-side light. Then switch the vehicles so the one to be aimed is back in the original spot. It must be parked no closer to or farther away from the wall than the second vehicle.

5.

Perform any necessary repairs, but make sure the vehicle is not moved, or is returned to the exact spot from which the lights were marked. Turn the headlights ON and adjust
the beams to match the marks on the wall.

6.

Have the headlight adjustment checked as soon as possible by a reputable repair shop.

WARNING
Do not touch the glass bulb with your fingers. Oil from your fingers can severely shorten the life of the bulb. If necessary, wipe off any dirt or oil from the bulb with rubbing
alcohol before completing installation.
7.

To ensure that the replacement bulb functions properly, activate the applicable switch to illuminate the bulb which was just replaced. (If this is a combination low and high beam
bulb, be sure to check both intensities.) If the replacement light bulb does not illuminate, either it too is faulty or there is a problem in the bulb circuit or switch. Correct if
necessary.

8.

Position the replacement headlight bulb; if applicable, secure the locking ring. Also install the access cover, if so equipped.

9.

Remove all tools, then close the vehicle's hood.
