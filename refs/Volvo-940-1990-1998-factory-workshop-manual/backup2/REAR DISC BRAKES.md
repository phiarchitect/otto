## Inspecting and Maintaining Rear Disc Brakes


Inspect the brake rotor for scoring and wear; minor scoring or disc pad lining build-up does not require rotor machining or replacement. If heavy scoring, cracks or other damage is evident,
replace or have the rotor machined, as necessary.
Glaze on the rotor can be removed by hand-sanding it with medium grit garnet paper or aluminum oxide sandpaper.
The minimum thickness of each brake rotor is indicated on the rotor itself. Do not utilize a rotor which is worn below the minimum allowable thickness. If rotor damage cannot be corrected by
grinding to these minimums, the rotor must be replaced.
Rotor lateral run-out must not be more than 0.001 in. (0.035mm).

Raise and safely support vehicle.

2.

Remove the wheel(s).

3.

Remove the brake caliper and hang it from the spring with a piece of wire.
