# GENERAL INFORMATION

## Towing Procedures and Recommendations


If a flatbed is unavailable, your vehicle can be towed using a T-hook wrecker. In this case, it is best to tow with the drive axle off the ground, as this will prevent wear and tear on the drive
train. Tow vehicle speed should not exceed 35 mph (56 km/h) when using this method.
WARNING
This method CANNOT be used on an AWD vehicle.

## Common Mistakes in Mechanical Work


Pay attention to the instructions provided. There are 3 common mistakes in mechanical work:
1.

Incorrect order of assembly, disassembly or adjustment. When taking something apart or putting it together, performing steps in the wrong order usually just costs you extra time;
however, it CAN break something. Read the entire procedure before beginning disassembly. Perform everything in the order in which the instructions say you should, even if you
can't immediately see a reason for it. When you're taking apart something that is very intricate, you might want to draw a picture of how it looks when assembled at one point in
order to make sure you get everything back in its proper position. We will supply exploded views whenever possible. When making adjustments, perform them in the proper
order. One adjustment possibly will affect another.

2.

Overtorquing (or undertorquing). While it is more common for overtorquing to cause damage, undertorquing may allow a fastener to vibrate loose causing serious damage.
Especially when dealing with aluminum parts, pay attention to torque specifications and utilize a torque wrench in assembly. If a torque figure is not available, remember that if
you are using the right tool to perform the job, you will probably not have to strain yourself to get a fastener tight enough. The pitch of most threads is so slight that the tension you
put on the wrench will be multiplied many times in actual force on what you are tightening. A good example of how critical torque is can be seen in the case of spark plug
installation, especially where you are putting the plug into an aluminum cylinder head. Too little torque can fail to crush the gasket, causing leakage of combustion gases and
consequent overheating of the plug and engine parts. Too much torque can damage the threads or distort the plug, changing the spark gap.
There are many commercial products available for ensuring that fasteners won't come loose, even if they are not torqued just right (a very common brand is Loctite® ). If
you're worried about getting something together tight enough to hold, but loose enough to avoid mechanical damage during assembly, one of these products might offer
substantial insurance. Before choosing a threadlocking compound, read the label on the package and make sure the product is compatible with the materials, fluids, etc.
involved.

3.

Crossthreading. This occurs when a part such as a bolt is screwed into a nut or casting at the wrong angle and forced. Crossthreading is more likely to occur if access is difficult.
It helps to clean and lubricate fasteners, then to start threading the bolt, spark plug, etc. with your fingers. If you encounter resistance, unscrew the part and start over again at a
different angle until it can be inserted and turned several times without much effort. Keep in mind that many parts, especially spark plugs, have tapered threads, so that gentle
turning will automatically bring the part you're threading to the proper angle. Don't put a wrench on the part until it's been tightened a couple of turns by hand. If you suddenly
encounter resistance, and the part has not seated fully, don't force it. Pull it back out to make sure it's clean and threading properly.
Be sure to take your time and be patient, and always plan ahead. Allow yourself ample time to perform repairs and maintenance. You may find maintaining your car a
satisfying and enjoyable experience.

## Labeling and Disconnecting Lines, Hoses, and Wires


Many procedures in this book require you to "label and disconnect . . . '' a group of lines, hoses or wires. Don't be lulled into thinking you can remember where everything goes — you won't.
If you hook up vacuum or fuel lines incorrectly, the vehicle may run poorly, if at all. If you hook up electrical wiring incorrectly, you may instantly learn a very expensive lesson.
You don't need to know the official or engineering name for each hose or line. A piece of masking tape on the hose and a piece on its fitting will allow you to assign your own label such as
the letter A or a short name. As long as you remember your own code, the lines can be reconnected by matching similar letters or names. Do remember that tape will dissolve in gasoline
or other fluids; if a component is to be washed or cleaned, use another method of identification. A permanent felt-tipped marker or a metal scribe can be very handy for marking metal parts.
Remove any tape or paper labels after assembly.

## Fasteners and Retainers


Although there are a great variety of fasteners found in the modern car or truck, the most commonly used retainer is the threaded fastener (nuts, bolts, screws, studs, etc.). Most threaded
retainers may be reused, provided that they are not damaged in use or during the repair. Some retainers (such as stretch bolts or torque prevailing nuts) are designed to deform when
tightened or in use and should not be reinstalled.
Fig. 1: Here are a few of the most common screw/bolt driver
styles

Whenever possible, we will note any special retainers which should be replaced during a procedure. But you should always inspect the condition of a retainer when it is removed and
replace any that show signs of damage. Check all threads for rust or corrosion which can increase the torque necessary to achieve the desired clamp load for which that fastener was
originally selected. Additionally, be sure that the driver surface of the fastener has not been compromised by rounding or other damage. In some cases a driver surface may become only
partially rounded, allowing the driver to catch in only one direction. In many of these occurrences, a fastener may be installed and tightened, but the driver would not be able to grip and
loosen the fastener again. (This could lead to frustration down the line should that component ever need to be disassembled again).
Fig. 2: There are many different types of threaded retainers
found on vehicles

Fig. 3: Threaded retainer sizes are determined using these
measurements

Fig. 4: Special fasteners such as these Torx(r) head bolts are
used by manufacturers to discourage people from working on
vehicles without the proper tools

If you must replace a fastener, whether due to design or damage, you must ALWAYS be sure to use the proper replacement. In all cases, a retainer of the same design, material and
strength should be used. Markings on the heads of most bolts will help determine the proper strength of the fastener. The same material, thread and pitch must be selected to assure proper
installation and safe operation of the vehicle afterwards.
Thread gauges are available to help measure a bolt or stud's thread. Most automotive and hardware stores keep gauges available to help you select the proper size. In a pinch, you can
use another nut or bolt for a thread gauge. If the bolt you are replacing is not too badly damaged, you can select a match by finding another bolt which will thread in its place. If you find a
nut which threads properly onto the damaged bolt, then use that nut to help select the replacement bolt. If however, the bolt you are replacing is so badly damaged (broken or drilled out) that
its threads cannot be used as a gauge, you might start by looking for another bolt (from the same assembly or a similar location on your vehicle) which will thread into the damaged bolt's
mounting. If so, the other bolt can be used to select a nut; the nut can then be used to select the replacement bolt.
In all cases, be absolutely sure you have selected the proper replacement. Don't be shy, you can always ask the store clerk for help.
WARNING
Be aware that when you find a bolt with damaged threads, you may also find the nut or drilled hole it was threaded into has also been damaged. If this is the case, you may have to drill and
tap the hole, replace the nut or otherwise repair the threads. NEVER try to force a replacement bolt to fit into the damaged threads.

## Safety Precautions


Don't run the engine in a garage or anywhere else without proper ventilation — EVER! Carbon monoxide is poisonous; it takes a long time to leave the human body and you can build
up a deadly supply of it in your system by simply breathing in a little every day. You may not realize you are slowly poisoning yourself. Always use power vents, windows, fans
and/or open the garage door.
Don't work around moving parts while wearing loose clothing. Short sleeves are much safer than long, loose sleeves. Hard-toed shoes with neoprene soles protect your toes and give a
better grip on slippery surfaces. Jewelry such as watches, fancy belt buckles, beads or body adornment of any kind is not safe working around a vehicle. Long hair should be tied
back under a hat or cap.
Don't use pockets for toolboxes. A fall or bump can drive a screwdriver deep into your body. Even a rag hanging from your back pocket can wrap around a spinning shaft or fan.
Don't smoke when working around gasoline, cleaning solvent or other flammable material.
Don't smoke when working around the battery. When the battery is being charged, it gives off explosive hydrogen gas.
Don't use gasoline to wash your hands; there are excellent soaps available. Gasoline contains dangerous additives which can enter the body through a cut or through your pores.
Gasoline also removes all the natural oils from the skin so that bone dry hands will suck up oil and grease.
Don't service the air conditioning system unless you are equipped with the necessary tools and training. When liquid or compressed gas refrigerant is released to atmospheric
pressure it will absorb heat from whatever it contacts. This will chill or freeze anything it touches.
Don't use screwdrivers for anything other than driving screws! A screwdriver used as an prying tool can snap when you least expect it, causing injuries. At the very least, you'll ruin a
good screwdriver.
Don't use an emergency jack (that little ratchet, scissors, or pantograph jack supplied with the vehicle) for anything other than changing a flat! These jacks are only intended for
emergency use out on the road; they are NOT designed as a maintenance tool. If you are serious about maintaining your vehicle yourself, invest in a hydraulic floor jack of at least a
1 1 ⁄ 2 ton capacity, and at least two sturdy jackstands.

## Safety Precautions


Do keep a fire extinguisher and first aid kit handy.
Do wear safety glasses or goggles when cutting, drilling, grinding or prying, even if you have 20–20 vision. If you wear glasses for the sake of vision, wear safety goggles over your
regular glasses.
Do shield your eyes whenever you work around the battery. Batteries contain sulfuric acid. In case of contact with the eyes or skin, flush the area with water or a mixture of water and
baking soda, then seek immediate medical attention.
Do use safety stands (jackstands) for any undervehicle service. Jacks are for raising vehicles; jackstands are for making sure the vehicle stays raised until you want it to come down.
Whenever the vehicle is raised, block the wheels remaining on the ground and set the parking brake.
Do use adequate ventilation when working with any chemicals or hazardous materials. Like carbon monoxide, the asbestos dust resulting from some brake lining wear can be
hazardous in sufficient quantities.
Do disconnect the negative battery cable when working on the electrical system. The secondary ignition system contains EXTREMELY HIGH VOLTAGE. In some cases it can even
exceed 50,000 volts.
Do follow manufacturer's directions whenever working with potentially hazardous materials. Most chemicals and fluids are poisonous if taken internally.
Do properly maintain your tools. Loose hammerheads, mushroomed punches and chisels, frayed or poorly grounded electrical cords, excessively worn screwdrivers, spread
wrenches (open end), cracked sockets, slipping ratchets, or faulty droplight sockets can cause accidents.
Likewise, keep your tools clean; a greasy wrench can slip off a bolt head, ruining the bolt and often harming your knuckles in the process.
Do use the proper size and type of tool for the job at hand. Do select a wrench or socket that fits the nut or bolt. The wrench or socket should sit straight, not cocked.
Do, when possible, pull on a wrench handle rather than push on it, and adjust your stance to prevent a fall.
Do be sure that adjustable wrenches are tightly closed on the nut or bolt and pulled so that the force is on the side of the fixed jaw.
Do strike squarely with a hammer; avoid glancing blows.
Do set the parking brake and block the drive wheels if the work requires a running engine.

## Rear Axle Identification and Location


The rear axle ratio and identification number (part number) are found on a label, located on the left-hand side of the axle housing.
Fig. 7: Rear axle ID tag location — heavy duty version
shown

## Engine Cooling and Oil System for Towing


One of the most common, if not THE most common, problems associated with trailer towing is engine overheating. If you have a cooling system without an expansion tank, you'll definitely
need to get an aftermarket expansion tank kit, preferably one with at least a 2 quart capacity. These kits are easily installed on the radiator's overflow hose, and come with a pressure cap
designed for expansion tanks.
Aftermarket engine oil coolers are helpful for prolonging engine oil life and reducing overall engine temperatures. Both of these factors increase engine life. While not absolutely necessary in
towing Class I and some Class II trailers, they are recommended for heavier Class II and all Class III towing. Engine oil cooler systems usually consist of an adapter, screwed on in place of
the oil filter, a remote filter mounting and a multi-tube, finned heat exchanger, which is mounted in front of the radiator or air conditioning condenser.

## Engine Identification


The engine serial number is stamped onto the engine block on the driver's side, just below the cylinder head. An identification tag or plate is also affixed to the timing cover. The engine size
can also be identified by reading the sixth and seventh digits of the VIN and using charts in this manual or other similar information to decode the VIN.

## Towing and Trailer Considerations


Your vehicle was primarily designed to carry passengers and cargo. It is important to remember that towing a trailer will place additional loads on your vehicle's engine, drive train, steering,
braking and other systems. However, if you decide to tow a trailer, using the prior equipment is a must.
Local laws may require specific equipment such as trailer brakes or fender mounted mirrors. Check your local laws.

## Trailer Towing Tips


Towing a trailer with ease and safety requires a certain amount of experience. It's a good idea to learn the feel of a trailer by practicing turning, stopping and backing in an open area such as
an empty parking lot.

## Determining Proper Hitch Weight and Trailer Class


Calculate the hitch weight in order to select a proper hitch. The weight of the hitch is usually 9–11% of the trailer gross weight and should be measured with the trailer loaded. Hitches fall
into various categories: those that mount on the frame and rear bumper, the bolt-on type, or the weld-on distribution type used for larger trailers. Axle mounted or clamp-on bumper hitches
should never be used.
Fig. 1: Calculating proper tongue weight for your trailer

Check the gross weight rating of your trailer. Tongue weight is usually figured as 10% of gross trailer weight. Therefore, a trailer with a maximum gross weight of 2000 lbs. will have a
maximum tongue weight of 200 lbs. Class I trailers fall into this category. Class II trailers are those with a gross weight rating of 2000–3000 lbs., while Class III trailers fall into the 3500
–6000 lbs. category. Class IV trailers are those over 6000 lbs. and are for use with fifth wheel trucks, only.
When you've determined the hitch that you'll need, follow the manufacturer's installation instructions, exactly, especially when it comes to fastener torque. The hitch will subjected to a lot of
stress and good hitches come with hardened bolts. Never substitute an inferior bolt for a hardened bolt.

## Introduction and Purpose


This manual for 1990–98 Volvo cars is intended to help you learn more about the inner workings of your vehicle while saving you money on its upkeep and operation.
The beginning of the book will likely be referred to the most, since that is where you will find information for maintenance and tune-up. The other sections deal with the more complex systems
of your vehicle. Operating systems from engine through brakes are covered to the extent that the average do-it-yourselfer becomes mechanically involved. This book will not explain such
things as rebuilding a differential for the simple reason that the expertise required and the investment in special tools make this task uneconomical. It will, however, give you detailed
instructions to help you change your own brake pads and shoes, replace spark plugs, and perform many more jobs that can save you money, give you personal satisfaction and help you
avoid expensive problems.
A secondary purpose of this book is a reference for owners who want to understand their vehicle and/or their mechanics better. In this case, no tools at all are required.

## Jacking Procedures and Safety Precautions


Your vehicle was supplied with a jack for emergency road repairs. This jack is fine for changing a flat tire or other short term procedures not requiring you to go beneath the vehicle. If it is
used in an emergency situation, carefully follow the instructions provided either with the jack or in your owner's manual. Do not attempt to use the jack on any portions of the vehicle other
than specified by the vehicle manufacturer. Always block the diagonally opposite wheel when using a jack.
A more convenient way of jacking is the use of a garage or floor jack. You may use the floor jack at the illustrated jacking locations.
Never place the jack under the radiator, engine or transmission components. Severe and expensive damage will result when the jack is raised. Additionally, never jack under the floorpan or
bodywork; the metal will deform.
When raising the vehicle with a floor jack, position the jack under the crossmember at the front of the vehicle or under the differential case (if equipped) of the rear axle at the rear. When
jacking at the front of the vehicle, do not position the jack under the gravel shield or the engine oil pan or you will damage these components.
Do not position the support stands under lower control arms or other slanted surfaces as they might slip and allow the vehicle to fall. The support stands can be placed beneath the rear
axle tubes at the rear of the vehicle and beneath the reinforced areas of the rocker panels or front frame members. The vehicle's weight should push vertically (downward) on the stands; the
stands should be on a level and solid base.
Whenever you plan to work under the vehicle, you must support it on jackstands or ramps. Never use cinder blocks or stacks of wood to support the vehicle, even if you're only going to be
under it for a few minutes. Never crawl under the vehicle when it is supported only by the tire-changing jack or other floor jack.
NOTE: Always position a block of wood or small rubber pad on top of the jack or jackstand to protect the lifting point's finish when lifting or supporting the vehicle.
Small hydraulic, screw, or scissors jacks are satisfactory for raising the vehicle. Drive-on trestles or ramps are also a handy and safe way to both raise and support the vehicle. Be careful
though, some ramps may be too steep to drive your vehicle onto without scraping the front bottom panels. Never support the vehicle on any suspension member (unless specifically
instructed to do so by a repair manual) or by an underbody panel.

2. Proper Techniques for Jacking and Supporting the Vehicle
3. Jacking and Support Guidelines for Vehicle Maintenance
4. Essential Safety Measures for Lifting and Supporting the Vehicle
5. Guidelines for Safely Elevating and Supporting


The following safety points cannot be overemphasized:
Always block the opposite wheel or wheels to keep the vehicle from rolling off the jack.
When raising the front of the vehicle, firmly apply the parking brake.
When the drive wheels are to remain on the ground, leave the vehicle in gear to help prevent it from rolling.
Always use jackstands to support the vehicle when you are working underneath. Place the stands beneath the vehicle's jacking brackets. Before climbing underneath, rock the
vehicle a bit to make sure it is firmly supported.

## Jump Starting Precautions and Procedure


Whenever a vehicle is jump started, precautions must be followed in order to prevent the possibility of personal injury. Remember that batteries contain a small amount of explosive
hydrogen gas which is a by-product of battery charging. Sparks should always be avoided when working around batteries, especially when attaching jumper cables. To minimize the
possibility of accidental sparks, follow the procedure carefully.
Fig. 1: Connect the jumper cables to the batteries and
engine in the order shown

CAUTION
NEVER hook the batteries up in a series circuit or the entire electrical system will go up in smoke, including the starter!
Vehicles equipped with a diesel engine may utilize two 12 volt batteries. If so, the batteries are connected in a parallel circuit (positive terminal to positive terminal, negative terminal to
negative terminal). Hooking the batteries up in parallel circuit increases battery cranking power without increasing total battery voltage output. Output remains at 12 volts. On the other hand,
hooking two 12 volt batteries up in a series circuit (positive terminal to negative terminal, positive terminal to negative terminal) increases total battery output to 24 volts (12 volts plus 12
volts).

## Battery Safety Precautions


Be sure that both batteries are of the same voltage. Vehicles covered by this manual and most vehicles on the road today utilize a 12 volt charging system.
Be sure that both batteries are of the same polarity (have the same terminal, in most cases NEGATIVE grounded).
Be sure that the vehicles are not touching or a short could occur.
On serviceable batteries, be sure the vent cap holes are not obstructed.
Do not smoke or allow sparks anywhere near the batteries.
In cold weather, make sure the battery electrolyte is not frozen. This can occur more readily in a battery that has been in a state of discharge.
Do not allow electrolyte to contact your skin or clothing.

## Jump-Starting Procedure


1.

Make sure that the voltages of the 2 batteries are the same. Most batteries and charging systems are of the 12 volt variety.

2.

Pull the jumping vehicle (with the good battery) into a position so the jumper cables can reach the dead battery and that vehicle's engine. Make sure that the vehicles do NOT
touch.

3.

Place the transmissions of both vehicles in Neutral (MT) or P (AT), as applicable, then firmly set their parking brakes.
NOTE: If necessary for safety reasons, the hazard lights on both vehicles may be operated throughout the entire procedure without significantly
increasing the difficulty of jumping the dead battery.

4.

Turn all lights and accessories OFF on both vehicles. Make sure the ignition switches on both vehicles are turned to the OFF position.

5.

Cover the battery cell caps with a rag, but do not cover the terminals.

6.

Make sure the terminals on both batteries are clean and free of corrosion or proper electrical connection will be impeded. If necessary, clean the battery terminals before
proceeding.

7.

Identify the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals on both batteries.

8.

Connect the first jumper cable to the positive (+) terminal of the dead battery, then connect the other end of that cable to the positive (+) terminal of the booster (good) battery.

9.

Connect one end of the other jumper cable to the negative (-) terminal on the booster battery and the final cable clamp to an engine bolt head, alternator bracket or other solid,
metallic point on the engine with the dead battery. Try to pick a ground on the engine that is positioned away from the battery in order to minimize the possibility of the 2 clamps
touching should one loosen during the procedure. DO NOT connect this clamp to the negative (-) terminal of the bad battery.
CAUTION
Be very careful to keep the jumper cables away from moving parts (cooling fan, belts, etc.) on both engines.

10.

Check to make sure that the cables are routed away from any moving parts, then start the donor vehicle's engine. Run the engine at moderate speed for several minutes to allow
the dead battery a chance to receive some initial charge.

11.

With the donor vehicle's engine still running slightly above idle, try to start the vehicle with the dead battery. Crank the engine for no more than 10 seconds at a time and let the
starter cool for at least 20 seconds between tries. If the vehicle does not start in 3 tries, it is likely that something else is also wrong or that the battery needs additional time to
charge.

12.

Once the vehicle is started, allow it to run at idle for a few seconds to make sure that it is operating properly.

13.

Turn ON the headlights, heater blower and, if equipped, the rear defroster of both vehicles in order to reduce the severity of voltage spikes and subsequent risk of damage to the
vehicles' electrical systems when the cables are disconnected. This step is especially important to any vehicle equipped with computer control modules.

14.

Carefully disconnect the cables in the reverse order of connection. Start with the negative cable that is attached to the engine ground, then the negative cable on the donor battery.
Disconnect the positive cable from the donor battery and finally, disconnect the positive cable from the formerly dead battery. Be careful when disconnecting the cables from the
positive terminals not to allow the alligator clips to touch any metal on either vehicle or a short and sparks will occur.

## Towing Methods and Considerations


If absolutely necessary, you can tow your vehicle with either the front or rear wheels on a dolly. Again, the preferred method would be to have the drive axle on the dolly, so the drive train is
not turning. All conditions which apply to the T-hook method also apply for the dolly method.
WARNING
This method CANNOT be used on an AWD vehicle.

## - Understanding Maintenance and Repair
- Importance of Maintenance in Preventing Costly Repairs
- Differentiating Maintenance from Repair
- The Cost-Effectiveness of Maintenance vs. Repair
- Basic Rules for Mechanics and Vehicle Terminology


It's necessary to mention the difference between maintenance and repair. Maintenance includes routine inspections, adjustments, and replacement of parts which show signs of normal
wear. Maintenance compensates for wear or deterioration. Repair implies that something has broken or is not working. A need for repair is often caused by lack of maintenance. Example:
draining and refilling the automatic transmission fluid is maintenance recommended by the manufacturer at specific mileage intervals. Failure to do this can shorten the life of the
transmission/transaxle, requiring very expensive repairs. While no maintenance program can prevent items from breaking or wearing out, a general rule can be stated: MAINTENANCE IS
CHEAPER THAN REPAIR.
Two basic mechanic's rules should be mentioned here. First, whenever the left side of the vehicle or engine is referred to, it is meant to specify the driver's side. Conversely, the right side of
the vehicle means the passenger's side. Second, screws and bolts are removed by turning counterclockwise, and tightened by turning clockwise unless specifically noted.
Safety is always the most important rule. Constantly be aware of the dangers involved in working on an automobile and take the proper precautions. See the information in this section
regarding SERVICING YOUR VEHICLE SAFELY and the SAFETY NOTICE on the acknowledgment page.

## Towing and Transporting Procedures


For maximum safety to the components of your drive train and chassis, it is most desirable to have your vehicle towed on a flatbed or whole vehicle trailer. The only way to properly place
the vehicle on a flatbed is to have it pulled on from the front.
Fig. 1: Towing hooks are provided; they are exposed when
the trim cover is removed

## Safety Precautions


It is virtually impossible to anticipate all of the hazards involved with automotive maintenance and service, but care and common sense will prevent most accidents.
The rules of safety for mechanics range from "don't smoke around gasoline,'' to "use the proper tool(s) for the job.'' The trick to avoiding injuries is to develop safe work habits and to take
every possible precaution.

prevent injury or damage which could result if the blade
slips from the screw

Fig. 2: Power tools should always be properly grounded

Fig. 3: Using the correct size wrench will help prevent the
possibility of rounding off a nut

Fig. 4: NEVER work under a vehicle unless it is supported
using safety stands (jackstands)

## Tools and Equipment


Normally, the use of special factory tools is avoided for repair procedures, since these are not readily available for the do-it-yourself mechanic. When it is possible to perform the job with
more commonly available tools, it will be pointed out, but occasionally, a special tool was designed to perform a specific function and should be used. Before substituting another tool, you
should be convinced that neither your safety nor the performance of the vehicle will be compromised.
Special tools can usually be purchased from an automotive parts store or from your dealer. In some cases special tools may be available directly from the tool manufacturer.

## Measuring Units and Conversion Factors


Throughout this manual, specifications are given to help you determine the condition of various components on your vehicle, or to assist you in their installation. Some of the most common
measurements include length (in. or cm/mm), torque (ft. lbs., inch lbs. or Nm) and pressure (psi, in. Hg, kPa or mm Hg). In most cases, we strive to provide the proper measurement as
determined by the manufacturer's engineers.
Though, in some cases, that value may not be conveniently measured with what is available in your toolbox. Luckily, many of the measuring devices which are available today will have two
scales so the Standard or Metric measurements may easily be taken. If any of the various measuring tools which are available to you do not contain the same scale as listed in the
specifications, use the accompanying conversion factors to determine the proper value.
The conversion factor chart is used by taking the given specification and multiplying it by the necessary conversion factor. For instance, looking at the first line, if you have a measurement
in inches such as "free-play should be 2 in." but your ruler reads only in millimeters, multiply 2 in. by the conversion factor of 25.4 to get the metric equivalent of 50.8mm. Likewise, if the
specification was given only in a Metric measurement, for example in Newton Meters (Nm), then look at the center column first. If the measurement is 100 Nm, multiply it by the conversion
factor of 0.738 to get 73.8 ft. lbs.
Fig. 2: Standard and metric conversion factors chart

## TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT: Importance and Recommendations


Naturally, without the proper tools and equipment it is impossible to properly service your vehicle. It would also be virtually impossible to catalog every tool that you would need to perform all
of the operations in this book. Of course, It would be unwise for the amateur to rush out and buy an expensive set of tools on the theory that he/she may need one or more of them at some
time.
The best approach is to proceed slowly, gathering a good quality set of those tools that are used most frequently. Don't be misled by the low cost of bargain tools. It is far better to spend a
little more for better quality. Forged wrenches, 6 or 12-point sockets and fine tooth ratchets are by far preferable to their less expensive counterparts. As any good mechanic can tell you,
there are few worse experiences than trying to work on a vehicle with bad tools. Your monetary savings will be far outweighed by frustration and mangled knuckles.
Begin accumulating those tools that are used most frequently: those associated with routine maintenance and tune-up. In addition to the normal assortment of screwdrivers and pliers, you
should have the following tools:
Wrenches/sockets and combination open end/box end wrenches in sizes 3mm–19mm 13 ⁄ 16 in. or 5 ⁄ 8 in. spark plug socket (depending on plug type).
NOTE: If possible, buy various length socket drive extensions. Universal-joint and wobble extensions can be extremely useful, but be careful when using them, as they
can change the amount of torque applied to the socket.
Jackstands for support.
Oil filter wrench.
Spout or funnel for pouring fluids.
Grease gun for chassis lubrication (unless your vehicle is not equipped with any grease fittings — for details, please refer to information on Fluids and Lubricants, later in this
section).
Hydrometer for checking the battery (unless equipped with a sealed, maintenance-free battery).
A container for draining oil and other fluids.
Rags for wiping up the inevitable mess.
Fig. 1: All but the most basic procedures will require an
assortment of ratchets and sockets

Fig. 2: In addition to ratchets, a good set of wrenches and hex
keys will be necessary

handy for old rusted parts and stripped bolt heads

Fig. 5: Various drivers, chisels and prybars are great tools to
have in your toolbox

Fig. 6: Many repairs will require the use of a torque wrench to
assure the components are properly fastened

In addition to the above items there are several others that are not absolutely necessary, but handy to have around. These include Oil Dry( (or an equivalent oil absorbent gravel — such as
cat litter) and the usual supply of lubricants, antifreeze and fluids, although these can be purchased as needed. This is a basic list for routine maintenance, but only your personal needs
and desire can accurately determine your list of tools.
After performing a few projects on the vehicle, you'll be amazed at the other tools and non-tools on your workbench. Some useful household items are: a large turkey baster or siphon, empty
coffee cans and ice trays (to store parts), ball of twine, electrical tape for wiring, small rolls of colored tape for tagging lines or hoses, markers and pens, a note pad, golf tees (for plugging
vacuum lines), metal coat hangers or a roll of mechanic's wire (to hold things out of the way), dental pick or similar long, pointed probe, a strong magnet, and a small mirror (to see into
recesses and under manifolds).

A more advanced set of tools, suitable for tune-up work, can be drawn up easily. While the tools are slightly more sophisticated, they need not be outrageously expensive. There are several
inexpensive tach/dwell meters on the market that are every bit as good for the average mechanic as a professional model. Just be sure that it goes to a least 1200–1500 rpm on the tach
scale and that it works on 4, 6 and 8-cylinder engines. The key to these purchases is to make them with an eye towards adaptability and wide range. A basic list of tune-up tools could
include:
Tach/dwell meter
Spark plug wrench and gapping tool

Feeler gauges for valve adjustment
Timing light
The choice of a timing light should be made carefully. A light which works on the DC current supplied by the vehicle's battery is the best choice; it should have a xenon tube for brightness.
On any vehicle with an electronic ignition system, a timing light with an inductive pickup that clamps around the No. 1 spark plug cable is preferred.
In addition to these basic tools, there are several other tools and gauges you may find useful. These include:
Compression gauge. The screw-in type is slower to use, but eliminates the possibility of a faulty reading due to escaping pressure.
Manifold vacuum gauge
12V test light
Combination volt/ohmmeter
Induction Ammeter. This is used for determining whether or not there is current in a wire. These are handy for use if a wire is broken somewhere in a wiring harness.
As a final note, you will probably find a torque wrench necessary for all but the most basic work. The beam type models are perfectly adequate, although the newer click types (breakaway)
are easier to use. The click type torque wrenches tend to be more expensive. Also keep in mind that all types of torque wrenches should be periodically checked and/or recalibrated. You
will have to decide for yourself which better fits your pocketbook, and purpose.

## Understanding Torque and its Importance in Fastening


Torque is defined as the measurement of resistance to turning or rotating. It tends to twist a body about an axis of rotation. A common example of this would be tightening a threaded retainer
such as a nut, bolt or screw. Measuring torque is one of the most common ways to help assure that a threaded retainer has been properly fastened.
When tightening a threaded fastener, torque is applied in three distinct areas, the head, the bearing surface and the clamp load. About 50 percent of the measured torque is used in
overcoming bearing friction. This is the friction between the bearing surface of the bolt head, screw head or nut face and the base material or washer (the surface on which the fastener is
rotating). Approximately 40 percent of the applied torque is used in overcoming thread friction. This leaves only about 10 percent of the applied torque to develop a useful clamp load (the
force which holds a joint together). This means that friction can account for as much as 90 percent of the applied torque on a fastener.

## Torque Angle Method for Precise Clamp Loads


Fig. 1: Some specifications require the use of a torque angle
meter (mechanical protractor)

Because the frictional characteristics of each fastener or threaded hole will vary, clamp loads which are based strictly on torque will vary as well. In most applications, this variance is not
significant enough to cause worry. But, in certain applications, a manufacturer's engineers may determine that more precise clamp loads are necessary (such is the case with many
aluminum cylinder heads). In these cases, a torque angle method of installation would be specified. When installing fasteners which are torque angle tightened, a predetermined seating
torque and standard torque wrench are usually used first to remove any compliance from the joint. The fastener is then tightened the specified additional portion of a turn measured in degrees.
A torque angle gauge (mechanical protractor) is used for these applications.

In most applications, a torque wrench can be used to assure proper installation of a fastener. Torque wrenches come in various designs and most automotive supply stores will carry a
variety to suit your needs. A torque wrench should be used any time we supply a specific torque value for a fastener. A torque wrench can also be used if you are following the general
guidelines in the accompanying charts. Keep in mind that because there is no worldwide standardization of fasteners, the charts are a general guideline and should be used with caution.
Again, the general rule of "if you are using the right tool for the job, you should not have to strain to tighten a fastener'' applies here.

Beam Type

Fig. 4: Example of a beam type torque wrench

The beam type torque wrench is one of the most popular types. It consists of a pointer attached to the head that runs the length of the flexible beam (shaft) to a scale located near the
handle. As the wrench is pulled, the beam bends and the pointer indicates the torque using the scale.

Click (Breakaway) Type

Fig. 5: A click type or breakaway torque wrench — note that
this one has a pivoting head

Another popular design of torque wrench is the click type. To use the click type wrench you pre-adjust it to a torque setting. Once the torque is reached, the wrench has a reflex signaling
feature that causes a momentary breakaway of the torque wrench body, sending an impulse to the operator's hand.

Pivot Head Type

Fig. 6: Torque wrenches with pivoting heads must be
grasped and used properly to prevent an incorrect reading

Some torque wrenches (usually of the click type) may be equipped with a pivot head which can allow it to be used in areas of limited access. BUT, it must be used properly. To hold a pivot
head wrench, grasp the handle lightly, and as you pull on the handle, it should be floated on the pivot point. If the handle comes in contact with the yoke extension during the process of
pulling, there is a very good chance the torque readings will be inaccurate because this could alter the wrench loading point. The design of the handle is usually such as to make it
inconvenient to deliberately misuse the wrench.
NOTE: It should be mentioned that the use of any U-joint, wobble or extension will have an effect on the torque readings, no matter what type of wrench you are using.
For the most accurate readings, install the socket directly on the wrench driver. If necessary, straight extensions (which hold a socket directly under the wrench
driver) will have the least effect on the torque reading. Avoid any extension that alters the length of the wrench from the handle to the head/driving point (such as a
crow's foot). U-joint or wobble extensions can greatly affect the readings; avoid their use at all times.

Rigid Case (Direct Reading)

Fig. 7: The rigid case (direct reading) torque wrench uses a
dial indicator to show torque

A rigid case or direct reading torque wrench is equipped with a dial indicator to show torque values. One advantage of these wrenches is that they can be held at any position on the wrench
without affecting accuracy. These wrenches are often preferred because they tend to be compact, easy to read and have a great degree of accuracy.

## Towing Capacity and Weight-to-Horsepower Ratio


The weight of the trailer is the most important factor. A good weight-to-horsepower ratio is about 35:1, 35 lbs. of Gross Combined Weight (GCW) for every horsepower your engine develops.
Multiply the engine's rated horsepower by 35 and subtract the weight of the vehicle passengers and luggage. The number remaining is the approximate ideal maximum weight you should
tow, although a numerically higher axle ratio can help compensate for heavier weight.

## Transfer Case or Bevel Gear Information


The transfer case or bevel gear as Volvo refers to it, has a stamped steel tag attached on the side.

## Importance of Automatic Transmission Coolers for Trailer Towing


An automatic transmission/transaxle is usually recommended for trailer towing. Modern automatics have proven reliable and, of course, easy to operate, in trailer towing. The increased load
of a trailer, however, causes an increase in the temperature of the automatic transmission fluid. Heat is the worst enemy of an automatic transmission. As the temperature of the fluid
increases, the life of the fluid decreases.
It is essential, therefore, that you install an automatic transmission cooler. The cooler, which consists of a multi-tube, finned heat exchanger, is usually installed in front of the radiator or air
conditioning compressor, and hooked in-line with the transmission cooler tank inlet line. Follow the cooler manufacturer's installation instructions.
Select a cooler of at least adequate capacity, based upon the combined gross weights of the vehicle and trailer.
Cooler manufacturers recommend that you use an aftermarket cooler in addition to, and not instead of, the present cooling tank in your radiator. If you do want to use it in place of the radiator
cooling tank, get a cooler at least two sizes larger than normally necessary.
NOTE: A transmission cooler can, sometimes, cause slow or harsh shifting in the transmission during cold weather, until the fluid has a chance to come up to normal
operating temperature. Some coolers can be purchased with or retrofitted with a temperature bypass valve which will allow fluid flow through the cooler only when the
fluid has reached above a certain operating temperature.

## Transmission Identification


The transmission type designation, serial number and part number appear on a metal plate affix to the left-hand side of the transmission, just above the transmission pan on automatic
transmissions/transaxles.
The manual transmission can be identified by referring to the Service Designation Number plate, found on the upper right side radiator support. A 10-digit Vehicle Identification Code (VIC),
located in the upper right-hand corner of the Service Designation Number plate, contains information on the type of transmission used. The 9th digit of the VIC designates the transmission
type.

The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is an identification code comprised of a seventeen-digit combination of numbers and letters. Each letter, number or combination represents different
items, such as manufacturer, type of restraint system, line, series and body type, engine, model year and consecutive unit number.
The VIN plate is located at the top left corner of the dashboard, just under the bottom of the windshield. The VIN number is also stamped on the right door pillar, on the certification label
located on the driver's door, and on the emission control label located on the underside of the hood. On some models, there is a vehicle plate on the passenger side shock tower or the
driver's side fender in the engine compartment that includes the VIN number, engine type, emission equipment, vehicle weights, and color codes.
