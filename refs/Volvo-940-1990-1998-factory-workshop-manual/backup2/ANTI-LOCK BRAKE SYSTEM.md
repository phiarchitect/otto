## Troubleshooting and Inspection Steps for ABS System Faults


1990–93 Vehicles
The Control Unit (CU) contains a monitoring circuit to detect any internal faults within the control unit, as well as electrical faults in the sensors, solenoids, modulator unit, etc.
If the monitoring circuit detects a fault, the control unit will disable the ABS system and light the warning lamp on the dashboard. If the light comes on during vehicle operation, perform the
following checks. All tests must be performed, in order.
1.

Remove the soundproofing under the left side of the dashboard. Inspect the 10 amp fuse on the transient surge protector, located adjacent to the ABS control unit.

2.

Check all connectors, wires and ground connections for the ABS system. Inspect the connectors at each component.

3.

Insure that the ignition is switched OFF.
A.

At the CU under the dashboard, depress the lock spring and swing out the connector, disconnecting it from the CU.

B.

Remove the cover from the connector. Remove the white protective moldings from the sides of the connector.

C.

Use an ohmmeter to check ground circuits. Terminal numbers are stamped into the side of the connector. The ABS wiring grounds at the left A-pillar. Test between
ground and terminals 10, 20, 32 and 34.
NOTE: Never check connectors from the front or terminal side; damage may be caused. Always check through the holes in the side of the
connector without using excessive force to make contact.

4.

5.

D.

Resistance should be 0 ohms in all cases. If any other reading is encountered, check for damaged wiring or improper connections. Wires are grounded on the left
A-post.

E.

If a fault is found at terminal 32, replace the solenoid relay on the hydraulic modulator and retest.

Check the transient surge protector:
A.

Turn the ignition switch ON.

B.

Connect a voltmeter between ground and terminal 1 on the control unit connector; 12 volts should be present.

C.

If no voltage is present, measure voltage directly at the transient surge protector connector. Terminals 1, 2 and 4 should be energized and terminal 3 should be
grounded.

D.

If only terminal 1 and 4 are energized when terminal 3 is grounded, the transient surge protector has failed and must be replaced.

Check the power supply to the control unit connector:
A.

Connect the voltmeter to a known good ground. Depress the brake pedal and at the same time, connect the meter to terminals 25, 27, 28 and 29.

B.

The voltmeter should read 12 volts at all terminals, except terminal 29.

C.

Voltage should read 0.5 — 1.0 volt at terminal 29.

6.

Start the engine. The voltmeter should read 12 volts at terminal 25.

7.

If no voltage or incorrect voltage is found in the above tests, proceed as follows. For a problem at:
A.

Terminal 25: Check brake lamp switch and replace if needed. Inspect brake light bulbs and replace as needed.

B.

Terminal 27: Replace defective solenoid relay.

C.

Terminal 28: Replace defective pump relay.

D.

Terminal 29: If reading at 27 is correct, voltage at 29 should be 0.5–1.0 volts. If not, replace solenoid relay.

8.

Turn the ignition switch OFF.

9.

Check voltage to the hydraulic modulator:

10.

A.

Remove the cover from the hydraulic modulator. Detach the connector from the hydraulic modulator.

B.

Switch the ignition ON.

C.

Connect the voltmeter to a know good ground and to terminals 6, 7, 10 and 12. Voltage in all cases should be 12 volts.

If there is no voltage or improper voltage to any terminal, proceed as follows. For a problem at:
A.

Terminal 6: Inspect wiring for shorts and/or poor connections.

B.

Terminal 7: Attach the connector to the hydraulic modulator with the ignition OFF. Turn the ignition ON when connected; the ABS warning lamp on the dashboard
should come on. If not, replace the warning lamp bulb.

C.

Terminal 10: Transient surge protector failed.

D.

Terminal 12: Inspect wiring for shorts and/or poor connections.

11.

Turn the ignition OFF; attach the connector to the hydraulic modulator.

12.

At the control unit connector, use an ohmmeter to measure the resistance of each wheel speed sensor.

13.

A.

Test the left front sensor between terminals 4 and 6. Test the right front sensor between terminals 11 and 21.

B.

Resistance for the front sensors must be 900–2200 ohms (0.9–2.2 kilohms). If the resistance is not within specifications, unfasten the harness connectors in the
engine compartment and measure resistance directly at the sensor. If the readings still differ, inspect the wiring and/or replace the sensor. Also, check the pulse
wheels for defects or damage; maximum radial run-out is 0.006 inch (0.15mm).

C.

Measure resistance of the rear speed sensor by testing at terminals 7 and 9. Resistance should be 600–1600 ohms (0.6–1.6 kilohms).

D.

If resistance is not correct, detach the sensor connector on the fuel filler pipe in the trunk. It will be necessary to break the connector seal; do so without damaging
the wiring. If readings are still not within specification, inspect wiring and/or replace the sensor.

Check the wiring to each sensor.
A.

Raise and safely support the vehicle.

B.

Connect an ohmmeter to the pairs of terminals use in Step 11.

C.

As each pair is tested, have an assistant turn the correct wheel on the vehicle including the rear. Rotate the wheel(s) about one revolution per second; the
resistance should vary as the wheel spins.

14.

Test the hydraulic modulator solenoid valves: Connect one ohmmeter lead to terminal 32 on the control unit connector. Connect the other test lead to terminal 2 (LF solenoid), then
35 (RF) and then 18 (rear); Resistance should be 0.7–1.7 ohms.

15.

Test the pump relay in the hydraulic modulator:
A.

Turn the ignition ON.

B.

Connect a jumper between terminal 28 on the control unit connector and ground. The pump should run.

C.

Repeat the test. Simultaneously, measure the voltage between terminal 14 and ground. With the jumper grounding terminal 28, 12 volts should be present.

D.

If the modulator does not start, inspect the wiring and connectors. If no fault is found, replace the pump relay and retest.

NOTE: Do not maintain the connection longer than 2 seconds; damage can occur.

16.

Test the valve relay in the hydraulic modulator:

A.

Connect the voltmeter between terminal 32 on the control unit connector and ground. Use a jumper wire to connect terminal 27 to ground. The valve relay on the
hydraulic modulator should activate (listen for distinct click) and the voltmeter should show 12 volts.

B.

If the relay does not energize, or the correct voltage is not present, inspect the wiring and connectors carefully.

C.

If no wiring fault is found, replace the valve relay.

17.

Turn the ignition switch OFF. Disconnect all test equipment.

18.

If no faults were found during testing, replace the ABS control unit and retest.

19.

Reinstall the hydraulic modulator cover and the soundproofing at the left side of the dashboard.

20.

Road test the vehicle and confirm proper system operation.

## Diagnostic Procedures for Pre-1993 and 1993-1995 Volvo 940 Anti-Lock Brake System


1990–92 Vehicles
On pre-1993 vehicles, the control unit does not store diagnostic codes; therefore diagnosis must be made in a progressive and logical order. The control unit contains a monitoring circuit to
detect any internal faults within the control unit as well as electrical faults in the sensors, solenoids, modulator unit, etc. Refer to the fault tracing procedure, later in this section.

1993–95 Vehicles
The CU stores trouble codes when a fault is detected. These DTCs can be retrieved using the Data Link Connector (DLC) located on the driver's side of the engine compartment. Connect the
selector cable to the DLC terminal 3. Turn the ignition to the ON position with the engine off. Press the button on the DLC and hold it down for about one second. Then press the button once,
pausing then four times, the Light Emitting Diode (LED) on the DLC will then flash the code. The LED will pause after each number. The codes are three-digit numbers; for example, flash,
pause, flash, flash, pause, flash, pause, would indicate code 121.
Fig. 1: Use the DLC to retrieve the ABS trouble codes

1996–98 Vehicles
1996 and later Volvos are equipped with OBD-II diagnostic capability. Codes are retrieved via the Data Link Connector (DLC), located in the console. The codes can be read after hooking
up the Volvo Scan tool or equivalent Diagnostic tool. Follow the menu on the scan tool to retrieve the DTCs.
Fig. 2: The DLC is located on the center console, in front of
the shifter handle

## Pre-Diagnostic Inspection for ABS Functionality


Before diagnosing an apparent ABS problem, make absolutely certain that the regular service braking system is in correct working order. Many common brake problems (dragging parking
brake, seepage, etc.) will affect the ABS system. A visual check of specific system components may reveal problems creating an apparent ABS malfunction.
Performing this inspection may reveal a simple failure, thus eliminating extended diagnostic time.
Inspect the tire pressures; they must be approximately equal for the system to operate correctly.
Inspect the brake fluid level in the reservoir.
Inspect brake lines, hoses, master cylinder assembly and brake calipers for leakage.
Visually check brake lines and hoses for excessive wear, heat damage, punctures, contact with other parts, missing clips or holders, blockage or crimping.
Check the calipers for rust or corrosion. Check for proper sliding action if applicable.
Check the calipers for freedom of motion during application and release.
Inspect the wheel speed sensors for proper mounting and connections.
Inspect the sensor wheels for broken teeth or poor mounting.
Inspect the wheels and tires on the vehicle. They must be of the same size and type to generate accurate speed signals.
Confirm the fault occurrence with the operator. Certain driver induced faults, such as not releasing the parking brake fully, spinning the wheels under acceleration, sliding due to
excessive cornering speed or driving on extremely rough surfaces may fool the system and trigger the dash warning light. These induced faults are not system failures but examples
of vehicle performance outside the parameters of the control unit.
Many system shut-downs are due to loss of sensor signals to or from the controller. The most common cause is not a failed sensor but a loose, corroded or dirty connector. Check
harness and component connectors carefully.
If the ANTI-LOCK warning lamp is on during vehicle operation, the control unit has detected a fault and disabled the system.
If the monitoring circuit detects a fault, the control unit will disable the ABS system and light the warning lamp on the dashboard. If the light comes on during vehicle operation, perform
diagnostics.

## ABS Operation and Components


The Anti-lock Braking System, designated ABS, prevents wheel lock-up. The ABS provides the shortest possible braking distance while maintaining full directional stability. The ABS
controls the front wheels individually and the rear wheels together. The rear piston in the master cylinder operates the front brakes and the front piston operates the rear axle brakes.
Under normal conditions, the ABS system functions in the same manner as a standard brake system and is transparent to the operator. The system is a combination of electrical and
hydraulic components, working together to control the flow of brake fluid to the wheels when necessary.
The Control Unit (CU) is the electronic brain of the system, receiving and interpreting signals from the wheel speed sensors. The unit will enter anti-lock mode when it senses impending
wheel lock at any wheel and immediately control the brake line pressures to the affected wheel(s) by issuing output signals to the hydraulic modulator.
The hydraulic modulator contains solenoids which react to the signals from the CU. When not activated, the solenoids allow brake line pressure to be modulated by the brake pedal in the
normal fashion. At the direction of the (CU), the solenoids move to positions either isolating the brake line from pedal pressure (pressure hold) or isolating the line and opening a passage to
relieve line pressure (pressure release). In this manner, brake application is controlled or actually lessened, dependent on the locking tendency of each wheel.
The decisions regarding these functions are made very rapidly and each solenoid can be cycled several times per second. Volvo employs a 3-channel control system. The front wheels are
controlled separately; the rears are watched by a single sensor on all models except the 850/C70/S70/V70 which have two, and the common feed line to the rear brakes is controlled by
one output on the hydraulic modulator.
The operator may feel a slight pulsing in the brake pedal and/or hear popping or clicking noises when the system engages. These sensations are due to the valves cycling and the
pressures being changed rapidly within the brake system. While completely normal and not a sign of system failure, these sensations can be disconcerting to an operator unfamiliar with the
system.
Although the ABS system prevents wheel lock-up under hard braking, as brake pressure increases, wheel slip is allowed to increase as well. This slip will result in some tire chirp during
ABS operation. The sound should not be interpreted as lock-up but rather as an indication of the system holding the wheel(s) just outside the locking point. Additionally, the final few feet of an
ABS-engaged stop may be completed with the wheels locked; the system is inoperative below 3 mph.
When the ignition is ON and vehicle speed is over 3 mph (5 kph), the CU monitors the function of the system. Should a fault be noted, such a loss of signal from a sensor, the ABS system
is immediately disabled by the CU. The ANTI-LOCK dashboard warning lamp is illuminated to inform the operator. When the ABS system is disabled, the vehicle retains normal braking
capacity without the benefits of anti-lock.
Some vehicles have a Traction Control System (TRACS) incorporated into the ABS system. The CU monitors the speed sensors just as it does for the ABS, and if one of the drive wheels is
detected moving faster than the other, it engages that wheel's brakes to reduce the power to the wheel. This is accomplished by closing and opening the solenoids in the hydraulic modulator,
causing the brake fluid to be "pumped" to that wheel, slowing the wheel rotation down and applying power equally.

## Wheel Speed Sensors and Electronic Control Unit (CU)


Wheel Speed Sensors
The speed signal is sent to the control unit via a sensor and pulse wheel assembly. Each front wheel has its own assembly. Rear wheel speed is measured by one sensor and pulse wheel
assembly on all vehicles except for the 850/C70/S70/V70 models which have one on each wheel.
As the teeth of the pulse generator pass the tip of the sensor, the changes from peak to valley to peak generate a small AC voltage in the sensor. The frequency of the voltage — which
increases with wheel speed — is used by the CU to determine wheel speed. By comparing wheel speed during braking, the control unit determines impending wheel lock.
Fig. 1: Various wheel speed sensors

Electronic Control Unit (CU)
The CU is located below the left dashboard, above the left kick panel on the 240 and most of the 700 series. It is located on the right front wheel housing on 760 models with a B280 engine.
On most other models, it is attached to the hydraulic modulator and is alongside the brake master cylinder. The unit is a microprocessor that receives and processes signals according to
predetermined logic, and supplies a control signal to the solenoid valves located on the hydraulic modulator.
The control unit contains the safety or monitor circuitry which will disable the ABS system if any electrical fault is detected. The safety circuit also monitors battery voltage and will disable the
system if voltage becomes too high or too low.
The electronic control unit cannot be repaired or serviced; if an internal fault is detected, the unit must be replaced.

Hydraulic Modulator
Usually located under or near the brake master cylinder in the engine compartment, the hydraulic modulator contains the solenoid valves, the system recirculation pump, the solenoid control
relay and the pump control relay. Certain engine and body combinations will locate the hydraulic modulator on the left wheel arch.
The 3 internal solenoids are electrically operated valves. When no current is applied, the valves are in the normal or open position, allowing brake fluid pressure to be controlled by the
brake pedal. Engagement of ABS causes the solenoid to move through part of its travel, blocking the brake fluid passage. This puts the valve in the hold position, maintaining existing brake
line pressure. If the CU still senses a wheel locking or about to lock, the solenoid is moved to the full extent of its travel, opening the pressure relief passage. Brake fluid in the circuit is
allowed to escape, reducing line pressure and releasing the brake. The released fluid is momentarily held in a pressure accumulator which serves to reduce the pedal pounding sensation to
the operator. Once released from the accumulator, the fluid is pumped back into the system for reuse.
With the exception of the two relays mounted on the unit, the hydraulic unit has no serviceable parts and cannot be repaired. If an internal fault is found, the unit must be replaced.
Fig. 2: Cutaway view of the hydraulic modulator assembly

Brake Lamp
The red dashboard BRAKE warning lamp functions in a manner identical to non-ABS vehicles. If the fluid level should drop below an acceptable level, the lamp will light as a warning to the
operator. If the BRAKE lamp is lit, braking function on the vehicle may be impaired; do not operate the vehicle until the status and reliability of the braking system is determined.

Anti-lock Lamp
The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) warning lamp is coupled to the ABS CU. The lamp will light briefly during engine start-up as the CU performs an initial check of the system. If no faults
are found, the CU will extinguish the lamp within a few seconds. After this initial test, the lamp should not come on during vehicle operation.

If the ABS lamp does come on during operation, the CU has detected a fault and disabled the system. If only the ABS warning lamp is lit, the vehicle retains normal braking characteristics
and may be safely driven. If both warning lamps are lit, the braking capacity of the vehicle may be impaired.
