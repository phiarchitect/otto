## Proper Car Washing Techniques and Tips


The car should be washed at regular intervals to remove dirt, dust, insects, and tar and other possibly damaging stains that can adhere to the paint and may cause damage. Proper exterior
maintenance also helps in the resale value of the vehicle by maintaining its like-new appearance.
NOTE: It is particularly important to frequently wash the car in the wintertime to prevent corrosion, when salt has been used on the roads.
There are many precautions and tips on washing, including the following:
When washing the car, do not expose it do direct sunlight.
Use lukewarm water to soften the dirt before you wash with a sponge, and plenty of water, to avoid scratching.
A detergent can be used to facilitate the softening of dirt and oil.
A water-soluble grease solvent may be used in cases of sticky dirt. However, use a washplace with a drainage separator.
Dry the car with a clean chamois and remember to clean the drain holes in the doors and rocker panels.
If equipped with a power radio antenna, it must be dried after washing.
CAUTION
Never clean the bumpers with gasoline or paint thinner, always use the same agent as used on the painted surfaces of the vehicle.
Tar spots can be removed with tar remover or kerosene after the car has been washed.
A stiff-bristle brush and lukewarm soapy water can be used to clean the wiper blades. Frequent cleaning improves visibility when using the wipers considerably.
Wash off the dirt from the underside (wheel housings, fenders, etc.).
In areas of high industrial fallout, more frequent washing is recommended.
CAUTION
During high pressure washing the spray nozzle must never be closer to the vehicle than 13 inches (30cm). Do not spray into the locks.
When washing or steam cleaning the engine, avoid spraying water or steam directly on the electrical components or near the distributor or ignition components. After cleaning the
engine, the spark plug wells should be inspected for water and blown dry if necessary.
Special car washing detergent is the best to use. Liquid dishwashing detergent can remove wax and leave the car's paint unprotected and in addition some liquid detergents contains
abrasives which can scratch the paint.
Bird droppings should be removed from the paintwork as soon as possible, otherwise the finish may be permanently stained.
WARNING
When the car is driven immediately after being washed, apply the brakes several times in order to remove any moisture from the braking surfaces.
WARNING
Engine cleaning agents should not be used when the engine is warm, a fire risk is present as most engine cleaning agents are highly flammable.
Automatic car washing is a simple and quick way to clean your car, but it is worth remembering that it is not as thorough as when you yourself clean the car. Keeping the underbody clean
is vitally important, and some automatic washers do not contain equipment for washing the underside of the car.
When driving into an automatic was, make sure the following precautions have been taken:
Make sure all windows are up, and no objects that you do not want to get wet are exposed.
In some cases, rotating the side view mirrors in can help to avoid possible damage.
If your car is equipped with a power antenna, lower it. If your vehicle has a solid mounted, non-power antenna, it is best to remove it, but this is not always practical. Inspect the
surroundings to reduce the risk of possible damage, and check to see if the antenna can be manually lowered.
WARNING
Most manufacturers do not recommend automatic car washing in the first six months due to the possibility of insufficient paint curing; a safe bet is to wait until after six months of ownership
(when purchased new) to use an automatic car wash.

## Cleaning and Maintenance of Upholstery, Leather, Floor Mats, and Carpet


Upholstery
Fabric can usually be cleaned with soapy water or a proper detergent. For more difficult spots caused by oil, ice cream, soda, etc., use a fabric cleaner available at most parts stores. Be
sure when purchasing the cleaner to read the label to ensure it is safe to use on your type of fabric. A safe method of testing the cleaner is to apply a small amount to an area usually
unseen, such as under a seat, or other areas. Wait a while, perhaps even a day to check the spot for fading, discoloring, etc., as some cleaners will only cause these problems after they
have dried.
Leather upholstery requires special care, it can be cleaned with a mild soap and a soft cloth. It is recommended that a special leather cleaner be used to clean but also treat the leather
surfaces in your vehicle. Leather surfaces can age quickly and can crack if not properly taken care of, so it is vital that the leather surfaces be maintained.

Floor Mats and Carpet
The floor mats and carpet should be vacuumed or brushed regularly. They can be cleaned with a mild soap and water. Special cleaners are available to clean the carpeted surfaces of your
vehicle, but take care in choosing them, and again it is best to test them in a usually unseen spot.

Dashboard, Console, Door Panels, Etc.
The dashboard, console, door panels, and other plastic, vinyl, or wood surfaces can be cleaned using a mild soap and water. Caution must be taken to keep water out of electronic
accessories and controls to avoid shorts or ruining the components. Again special cleaners are available to clean these surfaces, as with other cleaners care must taken in purchasing and
using such cleaners.
There are protectants available which can treat the various surfaces in your car giving them a "shiny new look", however some of these protectants can cause more harm than good in the
long run. The shine that is placed on your dashboard attracts sunlight accelerating the aging, fading and possibly even cracking the surfaces. These protectants also attract more dust to
stick to the surfaces they treat, increasing the cleaning you must do to maintain the appearance of your vehicle. Personal discretion is advised here.

## Points Requiring Lubrication and Maintenance


The body has several points that require periodic lubrication to maintain their quality operation. These points include the following:
Hood hinges: lubricate every 10,000 miles (16,000 km), use heavy oil.
Hood latch mechanism: lubricate every 10,000 miles (16,000 km), use general purpose grease.
Door hinges, stop and striker plates: lubricate every 10,000 miles (16,000 km). Lubricate the door hinges with heavy oil. Use door wax to lubricate the striker plates. Check that the
latches lock in both outer and inner positions.
Check that the door stops are in working order and provide positive locking in intermediate and outer positions.
Power Antenna: service the power antenna every 5,000 miles (8,000 km). Clean the antenna rod with ATF or other suitable lubricating oil. Wipe the rod clean and apply more oil on
the antenna; then run the antenna up/down a few times. Repeat as necessary, until the antenna is clean and functions properly.
Fig. 1: Lubricate any pivots or joints in the hood hinges

Fig. 2: Door hinge lubrication points

Fig. 3: Use a heavy oil to lubricate the door hinges

Fig. 4: Use wax on the striker latches

Fig. 5: Wipe the antenna clean and lightly lubricate with a
mild lubricant such as ATF to increase antenna motor life

## Vehicle Waxing and Preservation


NOTE: Before applying wax, the vehicle must be washed and thoroughly dried.
Waxing a vehicle can help to preserve the appearance of your vehicle. A wide range of polymer-based car waxes are available today. These waxes are easy to use and produce a longlasting, high gloss finish that protects the body and paint against oxidation, road dirt, and fading.
Sometimes, waxing a neglected vehicle, or one that has sustained chemical or natural element damage (such as acid rain) require more than waxing, and a light-duty compound can be
applied. For severely damaged surfaces, it is best to consult a professional to see what would be required to repair the damage.
Waxing procedures differ according to manufacturer, type, and ingredients, so it is best to consult the directions on the wax and/or polish purchased.

## Brake Fluid Recommendations


It is recommended that only brake fluid meeting the specification DOT 4+ (DOT 4) be used in the brake system. AVOID mixing different types of brake fluid.

## Brake Fluid Level Check and Adjustment


The fluid level should be checked at every 5,000 mile (8,000 km) intervals. It is recommended that the fluid be replaced at 30,000 mile (48,000 km) intervals. If the vehicle is subjected
to particularly hard wear, such as driving in mountainous regions, it should be changed at least once a year or every 15,000 miles (24,000 km).
CAUTION
Brake fluid contains polyglycol ethers and polyglycols. Avoid contact with the eyes and wash your hands thoroughly after handling brake fluid. If you do get brake fluid in your eyes, flush
your eyes with clean, running water for 15 minutes. If eye irritation persists, or if you have taken brake fluid internally, IMMEDIATELY seek medical assistance.
1.

Position the vehicle on a level surface.

2.

Locate the brake fluid reservoir in the engine compartment. Check the fluid reservoir and brake lines for leaks.

3.

Check the brake fluid without removing the cap. Adjust the level if necessary, using the recommended fluid. When filling the master cylinder, extreme cleanliness should be
observed to prevent dirt entering the system.
NOTE: Low fluid level may indicate worn brakes.
Fig. 1: The master cylinder reservoir is marked with MIN and
MAX levels

Fig. 2: Wipe the top of the master cylinder reservoir clean
before opening the cap to prevent contamination

Fig. 3: Pour the proper brake fluid directly into the reservoir;
if you use a funnel, be sure not to mix fluids

## Lubrication and Maintenance for Suspension, Driveline, and Steering Components


Check the suspension and driveline every 10,000 miles (16,000 km) intervals. Use regular chassis lube on applicable joints if binding is noticed.
Ball joints, suspension bushings and driveline joints are permanently lubricated at the factory and require no periodic lubrication. However, check the rubber seals of these parts for cracking
or damage. Replace any damaged seal with a new one, making sure to pack the new seal with multipurpose chassis grease. Many aftermarket parts used to replace these components will
contain a provision for lubrication. The easiest way to determine if a component can be lubricated is to look for a grease (Zerk) fitting.
On most models the steering stops require lubricating or a noise will be heard when the vehicle is turned all the way in either direction. To grease the stops, simply spread some a multipurpose grease, usually bearing grease over the surface.
Fig. 4: Lubricate the steering stops at every oil change
interval

## Proper Grease Fitting Maintenance and Lubrication Procedure


1.

Raise and support the vehicle safely.

2.

Locate all grease fittings on the vehicle. They are usually located on the at ball joints, suspension bushings and universal joints.

3.

Inspect the boot or seal for damage and replace as necessary. It is useless to attempt filling a damaged boot with grease as it will probably leak out.

4.

Remove the grease fitting cap.

5.

Clean the area around the grease fitting with a rag.

6.

Connect a grease gun to the fitting and pump grease into the joint until the boot or seal swells slightly. On a well maintained vehicle, this should be no more than 3–4 pumps.

7.

Remove the grease gun and install the grease fitting cap.

8.

Lower the vehicle.

NOTE: Some grease fittings may be obscured by road dirt or grease from an over zealous chassis lubrication.

NOTE: Do not overfill the component with grease. If grease exits the boot or seal, it is overfill.

## Clutch Fluid Level and Maintenance


The clutch master cylinder is located on the firewall, below the brake master cylinder, and adjacent to the power brake booster.
On some models, the clutch and brake fluid share the same reservoir and, therefore, the same fluid requirements. The clutch fluid level is checked when the brake fluid level is checked.
The fluid level in the reservoir has MIN and MAX markings, and the fluid level is OK if it is between these two lines.
NOTE: Low fluid level may indicate worn brakes.
CAUTION
Brake fluid contains polyglycol ethers and polyglycols. Avoid contact with the eyes and wash your hands thoroughly after handling brake fluid. If you do get brake fluid in your eyes, flush
your eyes with clean, running water for 15 minutes. If eye irritation persists, or if you have taken brake fluid internally, IMMEDIATELY seek medical assistance.
On models with a separate clutch master cylinder, the fluid should be in between the MIN and MAX levels.

## Coolant Replacement Procedure for a 1993 Volvo 940


It is recommended that the coolant be replaced at 30,000 mile (48,000 km) intervals. Perform this operation with the engine cold.
1.

Remove the expansion tank cap and set the heater controls to HOT.

2.

Raise the vehicle and support it safely.

3.

Open the petcock on the bottom of the radiator. If the coolant is to be reused, collect it in a clean container.

4.

Completely drain the radiator of all the coolant.

5.

Close the petcock and lower the vehicle.

6.

On models with an expansion tank, either use a siphon or unfasten the tank and hold it up so that all of the coolant in it flows into the radiator.

7.

Add coolant to the expansion tank until coolant is level with the MAX mark on the tank.

8.

Start the engine and let it idle until normal operating temperature is reached and check for leaks.

9.

Bleed the cooling system by leaving the cap off the expansion tank and the vehicle reaches normal operating temperature. The atmospheric pressure will aid in the removal of air
pockets from the system.

10.

Check the coolant level and refill if necessary.

11.

Install the expansion tank cap.

in the gravel shield

Fig. 2: Loosen the petcock using the proper size tool; most
vehicles require a 6mm Allen head wrench

Fig. 3: After the petcock is loose, coolant will start to drain out

Fig. 4: When the coolant is drained, remove the petcock,
then clean and inspect it before installation

Fig. 5: Pour the proper 50/50 coolant mixture into the
expansion tank to refill the system

## Proper Antifreeze Solution Ratio for Volvo 940


Volvo's all-weather antifreeze Type C (blue-green color) or equivalent should be used on a year round basis. The cooling system should always contain 50% antifreeze solution and 50%
water. Studies have shown that extremely weak antifreeze solutions (10–20%) provide poor rust protection, while antifreeze solutions in excess of 70% provide less effective boil over
protection.
Fig. 1: A tag is usually placed on the expansion tank or the
strut tower indicating the type of coolant to be used

Fig. 2: Volvo recommends mixing 50% coolant and 50%
water to fill the cooling system

## Cooling System Flushing and Refilling


1.

Proceed with draining the system as previously outlined.

2.

When the system has drained, reconnect the hoses and secure as necessary.

3.

Move the temperature control for the heater to its hottest position; this allows the heater core to be flushed as well.

4.

Using a garden hose, fill the radiator and allow the water to run out the engine draincocks. Continue until the water runs clear.

5.

Be sure to clean the expansion tank as well.
NOTE: If the system is badly contaminated with rust or scale, you can use a commercial flushing solution to clean it out. Follow the manufacturer's
instructions. Some causes of rust are air in the system, failure to change the coolant regularly, use of excessively hard or soft water, and/or failure to use
the correct mix of antifreeze and water.

6.

After the system has been flushed, continue with the refill procedures outlined above.

7.

Check the condition of the radiator cap and its gasket, replacing the cap if anything looks improper.

## Coolant Level Check and Top-Up Procedure


The coolant level should be checked at every 5,000 mile (8,000 km) intervals. The level should appear between the maximum and minimum marks of the translucent expansion tank. Do
not remove the expansion tank filler cap except to top up the system, as air might become trapped in the system and reduce cooling efficiency. Top up the system with a mixture of 50%
anti-freeze and 50% water; use this mixture all year round. If the engine is warm when you top up the cooling system, remove the filler cap slowly in order to allow any excess pressure to
escape.
CAUTION
Never open, service or drain the radiator or cooling system when hot; serious burns can occur from the steam and hot coolant. Also, when draining engine coolant, keep in mind that cats and
dogs are attracted to ethylene glycol antifreeze and could drink any that is left in an uncovered container or in puddles on the ground. This will prove fatal in sufficient quantities. Always drain
coolant into a sealable container. Coolant should be reused unless it is contaminated or is several years old.
Fig. 1: The expansion tank is marked with MIN/MAX levels;
the fluid should be between them

## Rear Axle Housing Fluid Drain and Refill Procedure


Drain and refill the rear axle housing every 100,000 miles (161,000 km) or any time the vehicle is driven in high water (up to the axle). Although some fluid can be removed using a suction
gun, the best method is to remove the rear cover to ensure that all of any present contaminants are removed. As with any fluid change, the oil should be at normal operating temperature to
ensure the best flow/removal of fluid and contaminants.
1.

Drive the vehicle until the lubricant reaches normal operating temperature.

2.

If necessary for access, raise and support the vehicle safely using jackstands, but be sure that the vehicle is level so you can properly refill the axle when you are finished.

3.

Use a wire brush to clean the area around the differential. This will help prevent dirt from contaminating the differential housing while the cover is removed.

4.

Position a drain pan under the rear axle.

5.

Loosen and remove all but one or two of the rear cover upper or side retaining bolts. The remaining bolt(s) should then be loosened to within a few turns of complete removal. Use
a small prytool to carefully break the gasket seal at the base of the cover and allow the lubricant to drain. Be VERY careful not to force or damage the cover and gasket mating
surface.

6.

Once most of the fluid has drained, remove the final retaining bolt(s) and separate the cover from the housing.

7.

Carefully clean the gasket mating surfaces of the cover and axle housing of any remaining gasket or sealer. A putty knife is a good tool to use for this. You may want to cover the
differential gears using a rag or piece of plastic to prevent contaminating them with dirt or pieces of the old gasket.

8.

Install the rear cover using a new gasket and sealant. Tighten the retaining bolts using a crisscross pattern.

9.

Refill the rear axle housing using the proper grade and quantity of lubricant, then install the filler plug.

To fill the differential:

NOTE: Make sure the vehicle is level before attempting to add fluid to the rear axle, otherwise an incorrect fluid level will result.
10.

Lower the vehicle, if applicable, then operate the vehicle and check for any leaks.

## Rear Axle Fluid and Lubricant Recommendations


The rear axle should be serviced with API GL-5, MIL-L-2105 B or C or equivalent, with a viscosity rating of SAE 90. When temperatures are below 15°F (-10°C), use SAE 80.
Use oils with the proper additives for vehicles equipped with a limited slip differential.
Fig. 1: If the vehicle is equipped with a limited slip rear axle
as noted by this tag, the proper oil or additive must be used

## Checking and Topping Up Rear Axle Oil Level


The fluid level should be checked at 10,000 mile (16,000 km) intervals.
1.

Raise and support the vehicle safely.

2.

Remove the rear axle level plug.

3.

Check that the oil level is up to the level plug hole. Top up, if necessary.

4.

Reinstall the rear axle level plug.

5.

Lower the vehicle.
Fig. 1: Location of the rear axle level plug on vehicles with a
solid rear axle

## Engine Oil and Filter Replacement Procedure


The engine oil and filter should be replaced according to your driving habits. Consult the maintenance intervals chart later in this section.
1.

Operate the engine for a few minutes. This increases the engine oil temperature and allows the oil to flow more rapidly.
CAUTION
The EPA warns that prolonged contact with used engine oil may cause a number of skin disorders, including cancer! You should make every effort to minimize your exposure
to used engine oil. Protective gloves should be worn when changing the oil. Wash your hands and any other exposed skin areas as soon as possible after exposure to used
engine oil. Soap and water, or waterless hand cleaner should be used.

2.

Raise and support the vehicle safely.

3.

Position a suitable drain pan under the engine oil pan drain plug.

4.

On most Volvos, use a 17mm wrench to remove the oil pan drain plug.

5.

Allow the oil to drain completely.

6.

Reinstall and tighten the drain plug. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN. Make sure you install the drain plug gasket before tighten the drain plug.

7.

Position the drain pan under the engine oil filter.

8.

Clean around the oil filter mounting surface with a shop rag.

9.

Using the an oil filter wrench, remove the oil filter.

10.

Lubricate the rubber oil seal of the new filter. Screw the filter on by hand; retighten with a wrench only if necessary.

11.

Lower the vehicle.

12.

Refill the crankcase to the normal oil level.

13.

Replace the filler cap.

14.

Start the engine and check for leaks.

15.

Shut OFF the engine. Wait a few minutes and check the oil level. Add oil if necessary.

16.

Reset the service indicator, as described earlier in this section.
WARNING
Operating the engine without the proper amount and type of engine oil will result in severe engine damage.
Fig. 1: Use a 17mm wrench to loosen the drain plug

Fig. 2: Unscrew the drain plug by hand, while keeping
inward pressure on it to prevent leakage

## Checking and Maintaining Engine Oil Level


CAUTION
The EPA warns that prolonged contact with used engine oil may cause a number of skin disorders, including cancer! You should make every effort to minimize your exposure to used engine
oil. Protective gloves should be worn when changing the oil. Wash your hands and any other exposed skin areas as soon as possible after exposure to used engine oil. Soap and water, or
waterless hand cleaner should be used.
It is a good idea to check the engine oil each time or at least every other time you fill your fuel tank. Check the engine oil level with the vehicle on level ground and the transmission in
PARK. When checking fluid level, use a clean rag that will not leave lint.
1.

Be sure the vehicle is on level surface.

2.

Shut OFF the engine and wait a few minutes to allow the oil to drain back into the oil pan.

3.

Remove the engine oil dipstick and wipe clean with a lint-free rag.

4.

Reinstall the dipstick and push it down until it is fully seated in the tube.

5.

Once again, remove the dipstick and note the level on the indicator. If necessary, fill to the normal level.
Fig. 1: Remove the dipstick from the engine

Fig. 2: The tag on the dipstick indicates that the oil level
should be between the . . .

Fig. 3: . . . MIN and MAX markings on the dipstick, as shown

## Proper Disposal and Recycling of Hazardous Fluids


Used fluids such as engine oil, transmission fluid, antifreeze and brake fluid are hazardous wastes and must be disposed of properly. Before draining any fluids, consult with your local
authorities; in many areas, waste oil, antifreeze, etc. is being accepted as a part of recycling programs. A number of service stations and auto parts stores are also accepting waste fluids for
recycling.
Be sure of the recycling center's policies before draining any fluids, as many will not accept different fluids that have been mixed together.

## Fuel Selection and Additive Precautions


NOTE: Some fuel additives contain chemicals that can damage the catalytic converter and/or oxygen sensor. Read all of the labels carefully before using any additive
in the engine or fuel system.
All vehicles covered by this manual are designed to run on unleaded fuel. The use of a leaded fuel in a vehicle requiring unleaded fuel will plug the catalytic converter and render it
inoperative. It will also increase exhaust backpressure to the point where engine output will be severely reduced. Obviously, use of leaded fuel should not be a problem, since most
companies have stopped selling it for quite some time.
The minimum octane rating of the unleaded fuel being used must be at least 87 (as listed on the pumps), which usually means regular unleaded. Some areas may have even lower octane
available, which would make 87 a midgrade fuel. In these cases a minimum fuel octane of 87 should STILL be used.
Fuel should be selected for the brand and octane which performs best with your engine. Judge a gasoline by its ability to prevent pinging, its engine starting capabilities (cold and hot) and
general all weather performance. The use of a fuel too low in octane (a measurement of anti-knock quality) will result in spark knock. Since many factors such as altitude, terrain, air
temperature and humidity affect operating efficiency, knocking may result even though the recommended fuel is being used. If persistent knocking occurs, it may be necessary to switch to
a different brand or grade of fuel. Continuous or heavy knocking may result in engine damage.
NOTE: Your engine's fuel requirement can change with time, mainly due to carbon buildup, which will in turn change the compression ratio. If your engine pings or
knocks switch to a higher grade of fuel. Sometimes just changing brands will cure the problem.
The other most important quality you should look for in a fuel is that it contains detergents designed to keep fuel injection systems clean. Many of the major fuel companies will display
information right at the pumps telling you that their fuels contain these detergents. The use of a high-quality fuel which contains detergents will help assure trouble-free operation of your
vehicle's fuel system.

## Recommended Oil Viscosity and Importance of Using Quality Oil


The recommended oil viscosity for sustained temperatures ranging from below -20°F (-30°C) to above 100°F (40°C) are listed in the section. The only oil type shown is multi-viscosity. Multiviscosity oils are recommended because of their wider range of acceptable temperatures and driving conditions.
When adding oil to the crankcase or changing the oil and filter, it is important that oil of an equal quality to original equipment be used in your vehicle. The use of inferior oils may void the
warranty, damage your engine, or both.
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grade number of the oil indicates the viscosity of the oil — its ability to lubricate at a given temperature. The lower the SAE number, the lighter
the oil; the lower the viscosity, the easier it is to crank the engine in cold weather, but the less the oil will lubricate and protect the engine at high temperatures. This number is marked on
every oil container.
When using engine oil, there are two types of ratings with which you should be familiar: viscosity and service (quality). There are several service ratings, resulting from tests established by
the American Petroleum Institute. The most current rating, SJ, is recommended for use in all engines. The SJ rating supersedes all other ratings.
Oil viscosity should be chosen from those oils recommended for the lowest anticipated temperatures during the oil change interval. Due to the need for an oil that embodies both good
lubrication at high temperature and easy cranking in cold weather, multi-grade oils have been developed. Basically, a multi-grade oil is thinner at low temperatures and thicker at high
temperatures. For example, a 10W-40 oil (the W stands for winter) exhibits the characteristics of a 10-weight (SAE 10) oil when the vehicle is first started and the oil is cold. Its lighter
weight allows it to travel to the lubricating surfaces quicker and offer less resistance to starter motor cranking than a heavier oil. But after the engine reaches operating temperature, the 10W40 oil begins acting like straight 40-weight (SAE 40) oil. It behaves as a heavier oil, providing greater lubrication and protection against foaming than lighter oils.
The American Petroleum Institute (API) designations, also found on oil containers, indicates the classification of engine oil used for given operating conditions. Only oils designated Service SJ
(or the latest superseding designation) heavy-duty detergent should be used in your vehicle. Oils of the SJ-type perform many functions inside the engine besides their basic lubrication.
Through a balanced system of metallic detergents and polymeric dispersants, the oil prevents high and low temperature deposits and also keeps sludge and dirt particles in suspension.
Acids, particularly sulfuric, as well as other by-products of engine combustion are neutralized by the oil. If these acids are allowed to concentrate, they can cause corrosion and rapid wear of
the internal engine parts.

## Recommended Fluids and Lubricants for Manual Transmissions


Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF) type F is recommended for manual transmissions. On the M46, engine oil SAE 10W-40 is recommended for use in areas where temperature seldom
drops below 14°F (10°C).

## Transmission Fluid Level Check and Top-Up Procedure


The fluid level should be checked at 10,000 mile (16,000 km) intervals.
1.

Raise and support the vehicle safely.

2.

Remove the transmission level plug.

3.

Check that the oil level is up to the filler hole. Top up, if necessary.

4.

Install the transmission level plug and lower the vehicle.

## Recommended ATF for Power Steering System


Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF) type F is recommended for the power steering system.

## Checking and Adjusting Fluid Levels


The fluid level should be checked at every 5,000 mile (8,000 km) intervals.
1.

Operate the vehicle until normal operating temperature is reached.

2.

Check the fluid level, with the engine idling, while fluid is still hot.

3.

Wipe the reservoir housing clean.

4.

Check that the fluid level is within the markings (MIN/MAX) on the dipstick which is attached to the cover.

5.

Adjust if necessary.

if necessary

## Fluid Replacement and Refilling for the Transfer Case


The transfer case cannot be drained while still attached to the transmission. However, an alternative method is to use a hand-held vacuum pump with a piece of hose and suck out the fluid.
Refill with the appropriate grade of oil.

## Transfer Case Oil Recommendation


The recommended oil for the transfer case is API-GL-5/SAE 80W, or equivalent.

## Rear Wheel Driveshaft Fluid Level Check


There is a plug to the left side of the flange for the rear wheel driveshaft. The level is checked by removing this plug and checking the fluid level. The fluid should be no more than 1 ⁄ 2 inch
(13mm) below this plug. If your finger is unable to fit in this opening, a small screwdriver works.
