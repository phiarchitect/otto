## Precautions for Working on Alternator Equipment


Several precautions must be observed when performing work on alternator equipment.
If the battery is removed for any reason, make sure that it is reconnected with the correct polarity. Reversing the battery connections may result in damage to the one-way rectifiers.
Never operate the alternator with the main circuit broken. Make sure that the battery, alternator, and regulator leads are not disconnected while the engine is running.
Never attempt to polarize an alternator.
When charging a battery that is installed in the vehicle, disconnect the negative battery cable.
When utilizing a booster battery as a starting aid, always connect it in parallel; negative to negative, and positive to positive.
When arc (electric) welding is to be performed on any part of the vehicle, disconnect the negative battery cable and alternator leads.
Never unplug the ECM while the engine is running or with the ignition in the ON position. Severe and expensive damage may result within the solid state equipment.

## Charging and Starting System Testing Procedures


Voltage Test

1.

Make sure the engine is OFF, and turn the headlights on for 15–20 seconds to remove any surface charge from the battery.

2.

Using a DVOM set to volts DC, probe across the battery terminals.

3.

Measure the battery voltage.

4.

Write down the voltage reading and proceed to the next test.

No-Load Test

1.

Connect a tachometer to the engine.
CAUTION
Ensure that the transmission is in
Park and the emergency brake is set. Blocking a wheel is optional and an added safety measure.

2.

Turn off all electrical loads (radio, blower motor, wipers, etc.)

3.

Start the engine and increase engine speed to approximately 1500 rpm.

4.

Measure the voltage reading at the battery with the engine holding a steady 1500 rpm. Voltage should have raised at least 0.5 volts, but no more than 2.5 volts.

5.

If the voltage does not go up more than 0.5 volts, the alternator is not charging. If the voltage goes up more than 2.5 volts, the alternator is overcharging.
NOTE: Usually under and overcharging is caused by a defective alternator, or its related parts (regulator), and replacement will fix the problem; however,
faulty wiring and other problems can cause the charging system to malfunction. Further testing, which is not covered by this book, will reveal the exact
component failure. Many automotive parts stores have alternator bench testers available for use by customers. An alternator bench test is the most
definitive way to determine the condition of your alternator.

6.

If the voltage is within specifications, proceed to the next test.

Load Test

1.

With the engine running, turn on the blower motor and the high beams ( or other electrical accessories to place a load on the charging system).

2.

Increase and hold engine speed to 2000 rpm.

3.

Measure the voltage reading at the battery.

4.

The voltage should increase at least 0.5 volts from the voltage test. If the voltage does not meet specifications, the charging system is malfunctioning.
NOTE: Usually under and overcharging is caused by a defective alternator, or its related parts (regulator), and replacement will fix the problem; however,
faulty wiring and other problems can cause the charging system to malfunction. Further testing, which is not covered by this book, will reveal the exact
component failure. Many automotive parts stores have alternator bench testers available for use by customers. An alternator bench test is the most

## Spark Plug Wire Replacement and Firing Order for Volvo 940


NOTE: To avoid confusion, remove and tag the spark plug wires one at a time, for replacement.
If a distributor is not keyed for installation with only one orientation, it could have been removed previously and rewired. The resultant wiring would hold the correct firing order, but could
change the relative placement of the plug towers in relation to the engine. For this reason, it is imperative that you label all wires before disconnecting any of them. Also, before removal,
compare the current wiring with the accompanying illustrations. If the current wiring does not match, make notes in your book to reflect how your engine is wired.
Fig. 1: 2.3L 4-Cylinder Engines Firing Order: 1–3–4–2
Distributor Rotation: Clockwise

Fig. 2: 2.8L 6-Cylinder Engine Firing Order: 1–6–3–5–2–4

## "Overview of the Starting System and Components in a 1993 Volvo 940"


The starting system includes the battery, starter motor, solenoid, ignition switch, circuit protection and wiring connecting the components. An inhibitor switch is included in the starting system
to prevent the vehicle from being started with the vehicle in gear.
When the ignition key is turned to the START position, current flows and energizes the starter's solenoid coil. The solenoid plunger and clutch shift lever are activated and the clutch pinion
engages the ring gear on the flywheel. The switch contacts close and the starter cranks the engine until it starts.
To prevent damage caused by excessive starter armature rotation when the engine starts, the starter incorporates an over-running clutch in the pinion gear.

## Understanding the Charging & Starting System


The automobile charging system provides electrical power for operation of the vehicle's ignition and starting systems and all the electrical accessories. The battery services as an electrical
surge or storage tank, storing (in chemical form) the energy originally produced by the engine driven generator. The system also provides a means of regulating generator output to protect the
battery from being overcharged and to avoid excessive voltage to the accessories.
The storage battery is a chemical device incorporating parallel lead plates in a tank containing a sulfuric acid/water solution. Adjacent plates are slightly dissimilar, and the chemical reaction
of the 2 dissimilar plates produces electrical energy when the battery is connected to a load such as the starter motor. The chemical reaction is reversible, so that when the generator is
producing a voltage (electrical pressure) greater than that produced by the battery, electricity is forced into the battery, and the battery is returned to its fully charged state.
The vehicle's alternator is driven mechanically, by a belt(s) that is driven by the engine crankshaft. In an alternator, the field rotates while all the current produced passes only through the
stator winding. The brushes bear against continuous slip rings rather than a commutator. This causes the current produced to periodically reverse the direction of its flow. Diodes (electrical
one-way switches) block the flow of current from traveling in the wrong direction. A series of diodes is wired together to permit the alternating flow of the stator to be converted to a pulsating,
but unidirectional flow at the alternator output. The alternator's field is wired in series with the voltage regulator.
The regulator consists of several circuits. Each circuit has a core, or magnetic coil of wire, which operates a switch. Each switch is connected to ground through one or more resistors. The
coil of wire responds directly to system voltage. When the voltage reaches the required level, the magnetic field created by the winding of wire closes the switch and inserts a resistance into
the generator field circuit, thus reducing the output. The contacts of the switch cycle open and close many times each second to precisely control voltage.
