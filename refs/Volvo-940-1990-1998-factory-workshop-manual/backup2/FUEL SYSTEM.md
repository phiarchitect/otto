# FUEL SYSTEM

## Fuel System Diagnosis and Testing


When there is a problem starting or driving a vehicle, two of the most important checks involve the ignition and the fuel systems. The questions most mechanics attempt to answer first, `is
there spark?'' and `is there fuel?'' will often lead to solving most basic problems. For ignition system diagnosis and testing, please refer to the information on engine electrical components
and ignition systems found earlier in this manual. If the ignition system checks out (there is spark), then you must determine if the fuel system is operating properly (is there fuel?).

## Fuel System Components and Operation


LH denotes that this is a "hot wire" system. The system is fully electronically controlled and incorporate a number of sensors, whose signals are processed by a control unit. There are
several different versions of the LH system, including the 2.2, 2.4, 3.1 and 3.2. The Bosch LH-Jetronic system is used in combination with the EZK ignition system and the turbocharged
control system, where applicable. The LH fuel system is characterized by the following:
Measurement of intake air through the air mass meter of the hot wire type
Use of a separate cold start valve that supplies extra fuel, at or below 60°F (16°C)
Knock controlled fuel enrichment system
Engine speed taken from an inductive transmitter on the flywheel
Lambda probe (oxygen sensor) providing oxygen content of the exhaust gases
EVAP system to minimize evaporation from the fuel tank
Three-way catalytic converter
Several sensors feed the control unit information to precisely control fuel injection. To accomplish this, the control unit evaluates: exhaust gas oxygen content from the oxygen sensor
(Lambda-sond), engine RPM and crankshaft position information from the ignition system control unit (if information is not received, the fuel system control unit will not function), engine
temperature from the coolant temperature sensor, engine load information from the air mass meter, information from the throttle switch, which indicates if the throttle is closed or wide open,
electrical system voltage from the battery current and signals from the A/C switch and clutch, indicating whether they are operating.

## Bosch Motronic Fuel Injection System and Functions


The Bosch Motronic fuel injection system is equipped with a powerful control unit that controls ignition and fuel injection functions by means of individual ignition coils and injectors. There are
several different Motronic fuel injection versions. These include the 1.8, 4.3, and 4.4.
In addition to controlling the ignition and fuel injection functions, Motronic also:
Determines whether the A/C compressor may be switched on
Reduces the engine torque in response to a signal from the automatic transmission control unit, to insure smooth engagement of the different gears, and also supplies the transmission
control unit with information on engine running conditions for computing gear changes
Controls the operation of the radiator fan
The control unit is provided with adaptive Lambda control and idling control functions, as well as timing retardation function, to eliminate knock. The service requirement is minimal, since
neither the carbon monoxide level nor the idling speed require adjustment.

## Fuel Line Connections and Removal Procedures


Most Volvo fuel lines use threaded-type connections. These connections are removed using the appropriate size flare-nut wrenches. Use one wrench to hold the male fitting, while the other
wrench turns the female fitting until the lines are separated.
Some connections do have quick-connect fittings. The fuel filter has a quick-connect fitting; it is removed using a 17mm wrench to depress the tab and remove the line. Other quick-connect
fittings have clips which must be removed before the line can be separated. NOTE: For additional information on Fuel Filter removal and installation, refer to Section 1 of this
manual.

## Testing Fuel Injector Operation


The easiest way to test the operation of the fuel injectors is to listen for a clicking sound coming from the injectors while the engine is running. This is accomplished using a mechanic's
stethoscope, or a long screwdriver. Place the end of the stethoscope or the screwdriver (tip end, not handle) onto the body of the injector. Place the ear pieces of the stethoscope in your
ears, or if using a screwdriver, place your ear on top of the handle. An audible clicking noise should be heard; this is the solenoid operating. If the injector makes this noise, the injector
driver circuit and computer are operating as designed. Continue testing all the injectors this way.
CAUTION
Be extremely careful while working on an operating engine, make sure you have no dangling jewelry, extremely loose clothes, power tool cords or other items that might get caught in a
moving part of the engine.

All Injectors Clicking
If all the injectors are clicking, but you have determined that the fuel system is the cause of your driveability problem, continue diagnostics. Make sure that you have checked fuel pump
pressure as outlined earlier in this section. An easy way to determine a weak or unproductive cylinder is a cylinder drop test. This is accomplished by removing one spark plug wire at a
time, and seeing which cylinder causes the least difference in the idle. The one that causes the least change is the weak cylinder.
If the injectors were all clicking and the ignition system is functioning properly, remove the injector of the suspect cylinder and bench test it. This is accomplished by checking for a spray
pattern from the injector itself. Install a fuel supply line to the injector (or rail if the injector is left attached to the rail) and momentarily apply 12 volts DC and a ground to the injector itself; a
visible fuel spray should appear. If no spray is achieved, replace the injector and check the running condition of the engine.

One or More Injectors Are Not Clicking
If one or more injectors are found to be not operating, testing the injector driver circuit and computer can be accomplished using a "noid" light. First, with the engine not running and the
ignition key in the OFF position, remove the connector from the injector you plan to test, then plug the "noid" light tool into the injector connector. Start the engine and the "noid" light should
flash, signaling that the injector driver circuit is working. If the "noid" light flashes, but the injector does not click when plugged in, replace the injector and retest.
If the "noid" light does not flash, the injector driver circuit is faulty. Disconnect the negative battery cable. Unplug the "noid" light from the injector connector and also unplug the ECM. Check
the harness between the appropriate pins on the harness side of the ECM connector and the injector connector. Resistance should be less than 5.0 ohms; if not, repair the circuit. If
resistance is within specifications, the injector driver inside the ECM is faulty and replacement of the ECM will be necessary.

## Fuel System Safety Precautions


Safety is the most important factor when performing not only fuel system maintenance, but any type of maintenance. Failure to conduct maintenance and repairs in a safe manner may
result in serious personal injury or death. Maintenance and testing of the vehicle's fuel system components can be accomplished safely and effectively by adhering to the following rules and
guidelines:
To avoid the possibility of fire and personal injury, always disconnect the negative battery cable unless the repair or test procedure requires that battery voltage be applied.
Always relieve the fuel system pressure prior to disconnecting any fuel system component (injector, fuel rail, pressure regulator, etc.), fitting or fuel line connection. Exercise extreme
caution whenever relieving fuel system pressure to avoid exposing skin, face and eyes to fuel spray. Please be advised that fuel under pressure may penetrate the skin or any part
of the body that it contacts.
Always place a shop towel or cloth around the fitting or connection prior to loosening to absorb any excess fuel due to spillage. Ensure that all fuel spillage (should it occur) is quickly
removed from engine surfaces. Ensure that all fuel soaked cloths or towels are deposited into a suitable waste container.
Always keep a dry chemical (Class B) fire extinguisher near the work area.
Do not allow fuel spray or fuel vapors to come into contact with a spark or open flame.
Always use a backup wrench when loosening and tightening fuel line connection fittings. This will prevent unnecessary stress and torsion to fuel line piping.
Always follow the proper torque specifications.
Always replace worn fuel fitting O-rings with new ones.
Do not substitute fuel hose or equivalent, where fuel pipe is installed.
Whenever servicing the fuel system, always work in a well ventilated area.
Always keep fuel in a container specifically designed for fuel storage; also, always properly seal fuel containers to avoid the possibility of fire or explosion.

## Regina Fuel Injection System and its Components


The Regina fuel injection system is a self-diagnosing system that is capable of storing up to 3 fault codes in its memory. It is used in conjunction with the REX-1 ignition system. Both are
adaptive systems that are capable of multiple adjustments based on previous driving. If a fault occurs, a warning lamp lights up the instrument panel. Fault tracing can be carried out using
the diagnostic program.
The Regina fuel system is characterized by the following:
A pressure sensor for measuring engine load
An air mass meter for measuring air intake volume
A separate cold start valve to ensure starting at low temperatures
An automatic idle shut-off valve if power is lost
An induction sensor, mounted on the flywheel, to indicate rpm and crankshaft position through the ignition system control unit
An electrically heated oxygen sensor (Lambda-sond)
EVAP system to minimize evaporation from the fuel tank
Three-way catalytic converter
Various input sensors feed information that is interpreted by the control unit to achieve optimum efficiency. The control unit receives signals from the pressure sensor, air intake temperature
sensor and receives crankshaft position information from the ignition control unit, without which the system will not function. The coolant temperature sensor, oxygen sensor and throttle switch
also send information to the control unit.
