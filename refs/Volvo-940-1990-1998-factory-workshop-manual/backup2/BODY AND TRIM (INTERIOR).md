## Door Panel Removal Procedure


The following procedure applies to both the front and rear door panels.
1.

Disconnect the negative battery cable.

2.

Remove all necessary retaining screws and clips; some are hidden by small access covers.

3.

On some models, it may be necessary to remove the door pocket. Remove it by turning the 3 studs 90 degrees and lifting off the pocket.

4.

On some models, it is necessary to remove the armrest. The screws may be concealed behind plastic covers.

5.

Remove the plastic housing around the inner latch release (door handle).

6.

If equipped with manual windows, remove the window crank handle. Do this by lifting up the small trim strip at the base of the winder. Remove the concealed screw and the
handle may be pulled free.

7.

Remove the door speaker mounting screws and pull the speaker out of the door, then unplug the connector and remove the speaker.

8.

Unscrew the lock button from the shaft.

9.

The door panel is removed by gently prying the edge away from the door. Use a broad, flat tool inserted between the panel and the metal of the door. The idea is to separate the
clips without damage so they may be reused.

10.

Proceed around the door until all the clips are released.
NOTE: If the door panel is tight or stuck in one spot, be careful and do not pull hard. First ensure that you have all necessary retaining hardware
removed.

11.

Remove the door panel by lifting up to free the lip at the window edge. Be prepared to disconnect any wiring encountered within the door (courtesy lights, speakers, etc.) during
removal.
NOTE: Inside the door is a plastic moisture barrier. It may be removed for access to the door parts, but it must not be ripped or torn. Should it become
damaged, either replace it or repair it with waterproof tape. It must be reinstalled intact after any door repairs.
To install

12.

Before reinstalling the door panel, check every clip to insure that they are properly located and not damaged. Replace any that are unusable.

13.

## "Removal and Installation of Manual Seats and Seat Belts"


Manual Seats
The front seat and its rails may be unbolted from the floor of the vehicle. Many vehicles have heated seats; it will be necessary to disconnect the wiring harness for this system before
removing the seat.
It is necessary to remove the seat belt anchor from the side of the seat. Remove the screw in the rear of the side pocket, lift the pocket out of the way and remove the seat belt bolt.
After all the retaining bolts are removed, the front seat is removed by sliding the seat to the rear of its track and lifting upwards to free the seat from the catches.
The rear seat cushion is removed by pressing down directly over the retaining clips (freeing the hook from the loop) and lifting the cushion clear. The rear seat backrest is held by catches
which hold the upper bar in place. These catches can be released with a screwdriver; don't bend them anymore than needed or reassembly will be very difficult.
When reassembling the rear seat, always install the backrest first. Make sure that every clip engages properly and is firmly closed.

## Importance of Professional Installation for Automotive Glass


If your windshield, or other fixed window, is cracked or chipped, you may decide to replace it with a new one yourself. However, there are two main reasons why replacement windshields
and other window glass should be installed only by a professional automotive glass technician: safety and cost.
The most important reason a professional should install automotive glass is for safety. The glass in the vehicle, especially the windshield, is designed with safety in mind in case of a
collision. The windshield is specially manufactured from two panes of specially-tempered glass with a thin layer of transparent plastic between them. This construction allows the glass to
"give" in the event that a part of your body hits the windshield during the collision, and prevents the glass from shattering, which could cause lacerations, blinding and other harm to
passengers of the vehicle. The other fixed windows are designed to be tempered so that if they break during a collision, they shatter in such a way that there are no large pointed glass
pieces. The professional automotive glass technician knows how to install the glass in a vehicle so that it will function optimally during a collision. Without the proper experience, knowledge
and tools, installing a piece of automotive glass yourself could lead to additional harm if an accident should ever occur.
Cost is also a factor when deciding to install automotive glass yourself. Performing this could cost you much more than a professional may charge for the same job. Since the windshield is
designed to break under stress, an often life saving characteristic, windshields tend to break VERY easily when an inexperienced person attempts to install one. Do-it-yourselfers buying
two, three or even four windshields from a salvage yard because they have broken them during installation are common stories. Also, since the automotive glass is designed to prevent the
outside elements from entering your vehicle, improper installation can lead to water and air leaks. Annoying whining noises at highway speeds from air leaks or inside body panel rusting
from water leaks can add to your stress level and subtract from your wallet. After buying two or three windshields, installing them and ending up with a leak that produces a noise while
driving and water damage during rainstorms, the cost of having a professional do it correctly the first time may be much more alluring. We, therefore, advise that you have a professional
automotive glass technician service any broken glass on your vehicle.
