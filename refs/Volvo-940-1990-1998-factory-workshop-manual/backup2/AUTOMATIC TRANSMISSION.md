## Automatic Transmission Adjustment and Shift Control


Before performing any adjustments, the following checks should be made: Check that the engine can be started, only with the selector lever in position P and with the brake pedal
depressed. The selector lever should stand vertically when in the P position. Check that the back-up lights illuminate only when the selector lever is in the R position. On AW 70/71/72
transmissions, check that the clearance from position D towards N is the same or smaller than the clearance between position 3 towards 2. On the AW 30-40 transmission, check that
there is a noticeable play from position D towards N; however, that play should not be greater than the play from position 3 towards L.

Shift Control

AW 70/71/72 TRANSMISSIONS

1.

Set the selector lever in position P. Loosen the retaining nuts for the shift control rod "A" and retaining arm "B".

2.

Check that the lever on the transmission is at position P (first step seen from the rear). Turn the transmission output shaft until it locks.

3.

Set the lever in the vertical position on the shift control rod, or just facing forward; tighten the nut. Push the retaining arm lightly to the rear until slight resistance is felt. Temporarily
tighten the retaining nut to 42 inch lbs. (5 Nm).

4.

Check that the clearance from position D towards N is the same or smaller than the clearance between position 3 towards 2.

5.

If incorrect:
A.

If the gear selector lever is stiff in position D, move the connecting rod 5 ⁄ 64 inch (2mm) to the rear.

B.

If the gear selector lever is stiff in position 3, move the connecting rod 1 ⁄ 8 inch (3mm) to the front.

6.

When the adjustment is correct, tighten the retaining nut to 13–17 ft. lbs. (17–23 Nm).

7.

After adjustment, check that the engine can be started, only with the selector lever in position P and with the brake pedal depressed. The back-up lights should illuminate only
when the selector lever is in the R position.
Fig. 1: Adjusting the shift control on AW 70/71/72
transmissions

AW 30/40 TRANSMISSION

1.

Place the selector lever in position P.

2.

Loosen the nuts on the control rod and reaction strut.

3.

Make sure the selector link arm on the transmission is in position P (rearmost gear position).

4.

Make sure the gear lever arm "A" is vertical (or slightly forward) and tighten the nut.

5.

Press the reaction arm "B" gently backwards until slight resistance is felt. Tighten the nut approximately 48 inch lbs. (5 Nm).

6.

Check that the play from position D towards N; is the same as the play from position 3 towards L.

7.

If incorrect:
A.

If there is no play in position D, move the reaction arm backwards approximately 0.08 inches (2mm).

B.

If there is no play in position 3, move the reaction arm forwards approximately 0.12 inches (3mm).

8.

When the adjustment is correct, tighten the retaining nut to 13–17 ft. lbs. (17–23 Nm).

9.

After adjustment, check that the engine can be started, only with the selector lever in positions P or N. The back-up lights should illuminate only when the selector lever is in the
R position.
Fig. 2: Adjusting the shift control on AW 30/40 transmissions

Kickdown Cable/Throttle Linkage

AW 70/71/72 TRANSMISSIONS

1.

Check that the wire is tensioned at idle setting, without tensioning against the throttle pulley, and that it is in the pulley groove and runs smoothly.

2.

Pull the wire out approximately 0.39 inch (10mm) and release suddenly. A mechanical click should be heard from the throttle cam, when it reaches the standby setting. Adjust
with the wire tensioner.

3.

A.

If no clicking is heard, the wire is too firmly tensioned.

B.

If no kickdown can be obtained, the wire is too slack.

Check the cable sheath adjustment with the throttle pedal in the vehicle depressed, not by actuating the linkage by hand. When depressing the throttle pedal fully, the distance
from the cable sheath to the clip should be 2.02 inches (51.5mm), but 1.98–2.06 inches (50.4–52.6mm) is permitted. If required, adjust the distance on the cable sheath.

## Understanding the Operation of the Automatic Transmission


The automatic transaxle allows engine torque and power to be transmitted to the front wheels within a narrow range of engine operating speeds. It will allow the engine to turn fast enough to
produce plenty of power and torque at very low speeds, while keeping it at a sensible rpm at high vehicle speeds (and it does this job without driver assistance). The transaxle uses a light
fluid as the medium for the transmission of power. This fluid also works in the operation of various hydraulic control circuits and as a lubricant. Because the transaxle fluid performs all of
these functions, trouble within the unit can easily travel from one part to another. For this reason, and because of the complexity and unusual operating principles of the transaxle, a very
sound understanding of the basic principles of operation will simplify troubleshooting.
