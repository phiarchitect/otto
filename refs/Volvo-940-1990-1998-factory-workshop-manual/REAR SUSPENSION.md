## Shock Absorber Function and Impact on Vehicle Handling

The purpose of the shock absorber is simply to limit the motion of the spring
during compression and rebound cycles. If the vehicle is not equipped with these
motion dampers, the up and down motion would multiply until the vehicle was
alternately trying to leap off the ground and to pound itself into the pavement.

Contrary to popular rumor, the shocks do not affect the ride height of the
vehicle. This is controlled by other suspension components such as springs and
tires. Worn shock absorbers can affect handling; if the front of the vehicle is
rising or falling excessively, the "footprint" of the tires changes on the
pavement and steering is affected.

The simplest test of the shock absorber is simply push down on one corner of the
unladen vehicle and release it. Observe the motion of the body as it is
released. In most cases, it will come up beyond it original rest position, dip
back below it and settle quickly to rest. This shows that the damper is
controlling the spring action. Any tendency to excessive pitch (up-anddown)
motion or failure to return to rest within 2–3 cycles is a sign of poor function
within the shock absorber. Oil-filled shocks may have a light film of oil around
the seal, resulting from normal breathing and air exchange. This should NOT be
taken as a sign of failure, but any sign of thick or running oil definitely
indicates failure. Gas filled shocks may also show some film at the shaft; if
the gas has leaked out, the shock will have almost no resistance to motion.

Fig. 1: When fluid is seeping out of the shock absorber, it's time to replace it

While each shock absorber can be replaced individually, it is recommended that
they be changed as a pair (both front or both rear) to maintain equal response
on both sides of the vehicle.  Chances are quite good that if one has failed,
its mate is weak also.
