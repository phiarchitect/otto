The acceleration sensor measures the vertical acceleration of the vehicle, helping the ECM distinguish a bumpy road from a genuine engine &#34;knock&#34;. The acceleration sensor works on the<br/>same principle as the KS. The acceleration sensor receives a steady voltage signal from the ECM and has a steady return signal. When the vehicle rides over a bumpy terrain, the return<br/>signal fluctuates, the fluctuation measuring the deviation of the terrain.<br/>
<b>NOTE: This sensor is found only on 1995 and later 850 models, 1996 and later 960 models and all 1998 models.</b><br/>

Fig. 1: Camshaft sensor components and location — 960<br/>
models<br/>
The function of the Camshaft Position (CMP) sensor is to tell the ECM if the camshaft is on the first or second revolution of an engine cycle. The CMP sensor allows the engine to determine<br/>which pistons are approaching TDC. The CMP sensor, in conjunction with the crankshaft position sensor, determine which cylinder requires ignition.<br/>
The CMP sensor consists of a trigger rotor and a Hall effect switch. The trigger rotor turns at the same speed as the camshaft. The ECM sends a 5-volt supply to the Hall effect sensor,<br/>which is grounded when the rotor passes the Hall effect switch, giving a zero voltage signal. When the sensor is shielded, the sensor returns the 5-volt signal to the ECM.<br/>

Fig. 1: The CKP sensor and pulse wheel<br/>
The Crankshaft Position (CKP) sensor, sometimes called an RPM and/or impulse sensor, is used to determine engine speed and Top Dead Center (TDC). This ensures precise ignition<br/>timing. The sensor is located at the rear of the engine block, above the flywheel. Engine speed is transmitted to the fuel control unit. The engine will not start without this signal.<br/>
<b>LH Jetronic and EZK Ignition System Vehicles</b><br/>
On the pulsewheel, there are 60 markings for the CKP sensor, 58 which are drilled holes to provide information to the ignition control unit. There are no holes at 2 of the markings. These are<br/>90 degrees Before Top Dead Center (BTDC), for cylinders No. 1 and No. 4. Ignition timing is based on these markings and other information such as engine load and temperature. This<br/>means that ignition timing can be controlled and that there is no need for the ignition setting to be adjusted.<br/>
<b>Regina Engine Control and REX-1 Ignition Systems</b><br/>
On the pulsewheel, there are 44 markings for the CKP sensor, 40 which are drilled holes to provide information to the ignition control unit. There are no holes at 2 of the markings. These are<br/>90 degrees Before Top Dead Center (BTDC), for cylinders No. 1 and No. 4. Ignition timing is based on these markings and other information such as engine load and temperature. This<br/>means that ignition timing can be controlled and that there is no need for ignition setting to be adjusted.<br/>
<b>Motronic Engine Control Systems</b><br/>
The flywheel has a series of holes located on the top surface. As the holes pass the CKP sensor, the holes induce a voltage in the coil of the sensor. The passage of several holes generates<br/>an A/C signal, the frequency of which is a function of the number of holes passing per second and the voltage of which can vary between 0.1 and 55 vdc, depending on engine speed and<br/>temperature.<br/>
At 90°TDC for cylinder 1 there is a longer hole. When the longer gap passes the sensor, the voltage stops, and the ECM can calculate camshaft position.<br/>

The Engine Control Module (ECM) performs many functions on your vehicle. The module accepts information from various engine sensors and computes the required fuel flow rate necessary<br/>to maintain the correct amount of air/fuel ratio throughout the entire engine operational range.<br/>
Based on the information that is received and programmed into the ECM's memory, the ECM generates output signals to control relays, actuators and solenoids. The ECM also sends out a<br/>command to the fuel injectors that meters the appropriate quantity of fuel. The module automatically senses and compensates for any changes in altitude when driving your vehicle.<br/>

The Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor resistance changes in response to engine coolant temperature. The sensor resistance decreases as the coolant temperature increases, and<br/>increases as the coolant temperature decreases. This provides a reference signal to the ECM, which indicates engine coolant temperature. The signal sent to the ECM by the ECT sensor<br/>helps the ECM to determine spark advance, EGR flow rate, air/fuel ratio, and engine temperature. The ECT also is used for temperature gauge operation by sending it's signal to the<br/>instrument cluster.<br/>

<b>1992 Volvo 940  <br/>Submodel:   | Engine Type:  L4 | Liters:  2.3<br/>Fuel Delivery:  FI | Fuel:  GAS</b><br/>
The Oxygen Sensor (O2S) is a device which produces an electrical voltage when exposed to the oxygen present in the exhaust gases. The sensor is mounted in the exhaust manifold.<br/>Some oxygen sensors are electrically heated internally for faster switching when the engine is running. The oxygen sensor produces a voltage within 0 and 1 volt. When there is a large<br/>amount of oxygen present (lean mixture), the sensor produces a low voltage (less than 0.4v). When there is a lesser amount present (rich mixture) it produces a higher voltage (0.6<br/>–1.0v).The stoichiometric or correct fuel to air ratio will read between 0.4 and 0.6v. By monitoring the oxygen content and converting it to electrical voltage, the sensor acts as a rich-lean<br/>switch. The voltage is transmitted to the engine controller. The controller signals the power module to trigger the fuel injector.<br/>
Later models have two sensors, one before the catalytic converter and one after. This is done for a catalyst efficiency monitor that is a part of the OBD-II engine controls that are on these<br/>year vehicles. The one before the catalyst measures the exhaust emissions right out of the engine, and sends the signal to the ECM about the state of the mixture as previously talked<br/>about. The second sensor reports the difference in the emissions after the exhaust gases have gone through the catalyst. This sensor reports to the ECM the amount of emissions reduction<br/>the catalyst is performing.<br/>
The oxygen sensor will not work until a predetermined temperature is reached, until this time the engine controller is running in what as known as OPEN LOOP operation. OPEN LOOP<br/>means that the engine controller has not yet begun to correct the air-to-fuel ratio by reading the oxygen sensor. After the engine comes to operating temperature, the engine controller will<br/>monitor the oxygen sensor and correct the air/fuel ratio from the sensor's readings. This is what is known as CLOSED LOOP operation.<br/>
A Heated Oxygen Sensor (HO2S) has a heating element that keeps the sensor at proper operating temperature during all operating modes. Maintaining correct sensor temperature at all<br/>times allows the system to enter into CLOSED LOOP operation sooner.<br/>
In CLOSED LOOP operation, the engine controller monitors the sensor input (along with other inputs) and adjusts the injector pulse width accordingly. During OPEN LOOP operation, the<br/>engine controller ignores the sensor input and adjusts the injector pulse to a preprogrammed value based on other inputs.<br/>

Fig. 1: A typical IAC valve assembly<br/>
An Idle Air Control (IAC) valve is incorporated into the system to set the correct air valve opening and constant idle speed. The valve consists of a stepper motor with twin coils, one for<br/>opening and one for closing. The ECM delivers pulsed ground signals to both IAC coils. Depending on the signals from the ECM, the motor operates a rotary valve which controls the air flow<br/>through the outlet port.<br/>
In the event of an electrical fault, a spring maintains the rotary valve in a fixed position and the idling speed is increased to approximately 1200 RPM. The ECM incorporates a self-learning<br/>system which enables it to learn the ideal idling speed. Because of this feature, the IAC valve is not adjustable.<br/>

The Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor determines the air temperature inside the intake manifold. Resistance changes in response to the ambient air temperature. The sensor has a<br/>negative temperature coefficient. As the temperature of the sensor rises the resistance across the sensor decreases. This provides a signal to the ECM indicating the temperature of the<br/>incoming air charge. This sensor helps the ECM to determine spark timing and air/fuel ratio. Information from this sensor is added to the pressure sensor information to calculate the air mass<br/>being sent to the cylinders.<br/>

The operation of the Knock Sensor (KS) is to monitor preignition or &#34;engine knocks&#34; and send the signal to the ECM. The ECM responds by adjusting ignition timing until the &#34;knocks&#34; stop.<br/>The sensor works by generating a signal produced by the frequency of the knock as recorded by the piezoelectric ceramic disc inside the KS. The disc absorbs the shock waves from the<br/>knocks and exerts a pressure on the metal diaphragm inside the KS. This compresses the crystals inside the disc and the disc generates a voltage signal proportional to the frequency of<br/>the knocks ranging from zero to 1 volt.<br/>

There is real no tests for this sensor, the sensor produces it's own signal based on information gathered while the engine is running. The sensors also are usually inaccessible without major<br/>component removal. The sensors can be monitored with an appropriate scan tool using a data display or other data stream information. Follow the instructions included with the scan tool for<br/>information on accessing the data. The only test available is to test the continuity of the harness from the ECM to the sensor.<br/>

The most important information for measuring engine fuel requirements comes from the pressure sensor. Using the pressure and temperature data, the ECM calculates the intake air mass. It<br/>is connected to the engine intake manifold through a hose and takes readings of the absolute pressure. A piezoelectric crystal changes a voltage input to an electrical output which reflects<br/>the pressure in the intake manifold.<br/>
Atmospheric pressure is measured both when the engine is started and when driving fully loaded, then the pressure sensor information is adjusted accordingly.<br/>
The pressure sensor terminal has 3 connectors A, B and C. A is ground, B carries the output signal to the control unit and C provides the pressure sensor with 5 volts of current from the<br/>control unit. The output varies between 0.5–5.0 volts depending on intake manifold pressure. When the engine is not running, atmospheric pressure will register at full potential. The sensor<br/>is sensitive to electrical disturbances, therefore it is protected by a metal cover. The signal strength should be about 4.4 volts at atmospheric pressure.<br/>

The sensor inside the air mass meter consists of a wire which is maintained at 250°F (120°C), above the ambient air temperature of the air entering the engine. As the air mass passing<br/>over the wire increases, more current is required to maintain the correct temperature. The amount of current required is used to calculate the air mass taken in.<br/>
When the engine is turned off, any dirt on the wire is burned off electrically as the element is heated to a temperature of 1832°F (1000°C) for 1 second. Any dirt remaining on the wire would<br/>cause it to send incorrect signals to the control unit and result in an incorrect air/fuel mixture.<br/>
