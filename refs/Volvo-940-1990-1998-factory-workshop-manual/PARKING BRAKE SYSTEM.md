# PARKING BRAKE SYSTEM


## Parking Brake Cable Adjustment Procedure

Refer to the Parking Brake Cable adjustment procedure, earlier in this section.


## Parking Brake System Maintenance and Adjustment

1. Using the appropriate parking brake cable adjustment procedure, gain access
   to the adjuster and loosen it so that the tension is removed from the cable.

2. Raise and safely support the vehicle safely

3. Remove the brake line-to-axle clamp, as required.

4. Remove the caliper and hang it out of the way. Be careful not to crimp hoses
   or lines.

5. Remove the disc. Don't attempt to remove the hub.

6. Using brake spring pliers, remove one retaining spring from the shoe
   assembly.

7. Remove the shoes from the vehicle, taking note of the location and placement
   of the adjuster.

8. Check for hydraulic leaks, worn components, and the brake shoes contact
   surface for signs of wear.

9. Thoroughly clean the hardware, surfaces, and backing plate with an
   appropriate brake cleaner.

To install:

10. Assemble the shoes with one spring and install onto the vehicle.

11. Install the other retaining spring.

12. Place adjuster in position and align shoes for disc reinstallation.

13. Install the brake disc. Check that the disc turns freely without binding on
    the shoes.

14. Reinstall the brake caliper. Always use new retaining bolts and tighten them
    to 42 ft. lbs. (57 Nm).

15. Reinstall the brake line-to-axle clamp, as required.

16. Adjust the brake shoes (except 700 series) and then the cables, as described
    earlier in this section.

17. Reinstall the wheels.

18. Lower the vehicle.

19. Check the emergency brake for proper holding and adjust the cables as
    necessary. Full braking effect must be possible within 3–5 notches, after
    adjustment.

## Adjusting the Parking Brake System for 1993 Volvo 940

1. The parking brake should be fully applied when the handle is moved no more
   than ten notches. If adjustment is required, adjust the brake shoes first.

2. For 850 models, full braking should be reached when the handle is raised
   about five notches. If cable adjustment is required:

    A.  Remove the square cover plate under the armrest in the middle console.


    B.  Turn the adjustment screw so that full braking is obtained between the
    second and eighth notch.


    C.  Replace the square cover plate.

3. Raise and safely support the vehicle.

4. Remove the rear wheels.

5. With the brake handle released, install a brake adjusting tool through the
   hole in the rotor between the studs.

6. Turn the adjuster wheel until the rotor will not turn.

7. Loosen the adjuster wheel 4–5 notches.

8. Make sure the rotor turns freely. If the shoes are binding inside the rotor
   even after loosening the adjuster more, remove the rotor to repair the
   problem.

9. Move the handle again: adequate braking power should be obtained at 3–7
   notches with a normal pull force of approximately 65 lbs. (84 Nm). If cable
   adjustment is required, remove the access panel behind the brake handle and
   adjust through the opening in the rear console.

10. The yoke on top of the brake handle should be at right angles to the parking
    brake lever. If the yoke is out of alignment, lower the handle and turn the
    nuts at the cable ends to adjust. There should always be at least 0.1 inch
    (2mm) thread protruding.

11. Make sure the indicator light on the instrument panel illuminates when the
    brake is applied.  Fig. 1: The parking brake is adjusted through an opening
    in the rotor on 850/C70/S70/V70 models

## Precautions

The cable operated emergency brake is a complete separate brake system acting
only on the rear wheels. When the lever in the vehicle is pulled up, cables
running to the rear of the vehicle actuate 2 sets of brake shoes. These shoes
expand against the machined surface inside the rear brake disc. The system must,
however, remain in proper repair and adjustment so that it will hold the vehicle
when parked and be available for emergency use if needed.
