The primary door adjustments are carried out at the hinge bolts at the forward end of each door. Further adjustment for the closed position and for latching smoothness may be made at the
latch plate or striker. This piece is located at the rear edge of the door and is attached to the bodywork of the vehicle; it is the piece which the door engages when closed.
Although the striker or latchplate is different on various models, the adjustment procedure is the same:
1.

Adjust the position of the door by moving the striker plate sideways.

2.

If further adjustments are necessary, first slacken the upper door hinge bolts, then, if necessary, the lower 2 bolts. Push the door toward the body.

3.

After the striker bolts have been tightened, open and close the door several times. Observe the motion of the door as it engages the striker; it should continue its straight-in motion
and not deflect up or down as it hits the striker.

4.

Check the feel of the latch during opening and closing. It must be smooth and linear, without any trace of grinding or binding during engagement and release.

NOTE: Never loosen more than 3 bolts at a time or the door may drop. Do not attempt to correct height variations (sag) by adjusting the striker.

NOTE: It may be necessary to repeat the striker adjustment procedure several times (and possibly adjust the hinges) before the proper door-to-body
alignment is corrected.

NOTE: The doors are heavy! Provide proper support for the door when removing. Do not allow the door to sag while partially attached and do not subject the door to
impact or twisting movements.
1.

Disconnect the negative battery cable.

2.

Disconnect any wiring harnesses running into the door. This may be done either inside the door (remove the door panel) or under the dashboard, inside the pillar. Make sure the
wiring harness will not catch or bind as the door is removed from the vehicle.

3.

Scribe marks around the hinges to facilitate door installation.

4.

Support the door with a jack. Place a piece of wood on the jack to protect the paintwork.

5.

Have a helper support the door, then loosen and remove the hinge mounting bolts and remove the door from the vehicle.

6.

With an assistant, position the door and install the hinge bolts. Do not fully tighten the hinge mounting bolts at this time.

7.

Check the door for proper alignment. If required, loosen the mounting bolts just enough to allow the door to be moved into position.

8.

Tighten all the hinge bolts and check the final fit.

9.

If the door stop bracket was removed, reinstall it.

To install:

10.

Connect the wiring harness and check the function of electrical components in the door. Install the door panel if removed.

11.

Connect the negative battery cable.

The plastic grilles on these vehicles are retained by a variety of plastic clips and screws. With the hood raised, remove all the retaining hardware and lift the grille clear of the vehicle. Be
careful of any wires and/or tubing running between the grille and the radiator. Do not force the grille into position or it will crack; work carefully and make sure everything lines up before
tightening the mounting hardware.
On some models, the grille is an integral part of the hood and removal of the hood also removes the grille. This can be verified when the hood is opened; if the grille is attached, it will raise
with the hood.

The power antenna extends when the radio is turned ON. The mast will retract when the radio is turned OFF. The 700 and 900 Series vehicles have a switch that allows the antenna to be
retracted with the radio ON. The switch will also prevent the mast from extending when the radio is first turned ON. There are 3 leads to the power antenna unit. There is a ground lead that
is electrically connected to the chassis and a green or green and red power lead connected to the fuse box to provide operating voltage. The third lead is connected to the radio (through a
switch for the 700 and 900 series vehicles) to provide the signal for antenna operation. When there is power on this lead, the antenna extends; when the power is removed, by turning
OFF the radio or turning OFF the antenna switch on 700 and 900 series vehicles, the antenna retracts.

All Models
Both trunk lids and wagon liftgates are adjustable on their hinges due to slotted holes. The trunk lids are also adjustable by loosening the hinge-to-body bolts and repositioning the hinge
vertically.
Wagon liftgates have additional adjusters on the sides. Loosen their screws a few turns and close the liftgate. The adjuster should seek the correct position for smooth operation. Because of
the curve of the body and roofline, the wagon liftgate needs to be checked carefully for alignment to the body. Seams should be straight and even, and panels should be flush with no
obvious high or low points.
Final adjustments are made at the latch (on the lid) and the striker (on the body). Each can be loosened and moved on its mounts to control tightness and ease of operation. It is
recommended to start by loosening the striker only; close the lid or liftgate and let the striker seek its position. Continue adjusting until the latch has no binding in its operation, the key turns
freely and the weatherstrip is evenly compressed around the lid/liftgate.

2 and 4-Door Models

1.

Open the trunk lid. Have a helper support the lid; remove the retaining clip for the gas shock (which holds the lid open) and disconnect it from the lid.

2.

Detach any wiring to the trunk lid at the nearest connector. Make sure the wiring will not bind when the lid is removed.

3.

Scribe marks around the hinges to facilitate trunk lid installation.

4.

Remove the bolts which hold the hinges to the trunk lid and lift the lid clear of the vehicle.
NOTE: Trunk lids can be easily damaged; take great care not to bend or dimple the trunk lid. Store it on pads and cover it to protect it while off the
vehicle.
To install:

5.

Place the lid into position and lightly tighten the bolts until snug.

6.

Check the lid-to-body alignment and adjust the trunk lid as necessary.

7.

Final-tighten the bolts.

8.

Reattach the gas shock to the trunk lid and reconnect the wiring, if any.

Wagon (5-Door Model)
NOTE: Because of the size and weight of the liftgate, this procedure requires 2 people during removal and installation.
1.

Remove the inner cover panel on the liftgate.

2.

Detach any electrical connectors within the liftgate. Tag or identify the connectors for ease of reassembly.

3.

Pull the harness through the hole in the top of the liftgate.

4.

While your helper supports the liftgate, disconnect the gas shock(s).

5.

With the liftgate safely supported, remove the liftgate-to-hinge bolts on each side at the top. On the 740, one of the bolts is beneath a rubber plug which must be removed.

6.

Remove the liftgate from the vehicle and store it on pads.

7.

Place the liftgate into position and loosely tighten the bolts until snug.

8.

Check the alignment of the liftgate in relation to the body, and adjust it as necessary.

9.

When the alignment is correct, final-tighten the hinge bolts. Left-right alignment is critical. Take your time and work for an even fit.

To install:

10.

Connect the gas shock(s) to the liftgate.

11.

Feed the wire harness through the hole at the top of the liftgate and into position.

12.

Connect the wires to the proper points.
