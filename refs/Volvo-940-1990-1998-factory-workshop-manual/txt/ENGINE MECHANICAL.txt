Electric Cooling Fan
Some models are equipped with electric cooling fans. The fan function is controlled by a thermocontact placed in the upper right corner of the radiator. Some vehicles may be equipped with
a thermal switch in the radiator end tank or lower radiator hose. The fan, on most models, will generally switch ON when coolant temperatures are 190–212°F (88–100°C).
B6304F engines are fitted with a fully electric radiator fan. The 2-speed fan is mounted behind the radiator. The fan is controlled by a relay, in response to either temperature signal sent to the
Motronic control unit or directly by the pressure switches mounted in the A/C high-pressure circuit. The relay is mounted on a bracket in front of the battery.

In the process of removing the engine, you will come across a number of steps which call for the removal of a separate component or system, such as "disconnect the exhaust system'' or
"remove the radiator.'' In most instances, a detailed removal procedure can be found elsewhere in this manual.
It is virtually impossible to list each individual wire and hose which must be disconnected, simply because so many different model and engine combinations have been manufactured.
Careful observation and common sense are the best possible approaches to any repair procedure.
Removal and installation of the engine can be made easier if you follow these basic points:
If you have to drain any of the fluids, use a suitable container.
Always tag any wires or hoses and, if possible, the components they came from before disconnecting them.
Because there are so many bolts and fasteners involved, store and label the retainers from components separately in muffin pans, jars or coffee cans. This will prevent confusion
during installation.
After unbolting the transmission or transaxle, always make sure it is properly supported.
If it is necessary to disconnect the air conditioning system, have this service performed by a qualified technician using a recovery/recycling station. If the system does not have to be
disconnected, unbolt the compressor and set it aside.
When unbolting the engine mounts, always make sure the engine is properly supported. When removing the engine, make sure that any lifting devices are properly attached to the
engine. It is recommended that if your engine is supplied with lifting hooks, your lifting apparatus be attached to them.
Lift the engine from its compartment slowly, checking that no hoses, wires or other components are still connected.
After the engine is clear of the compartment, place it on an engine stand or workbench.
After the engine has been removed, you can perform a partial or full teardown of the engine using the procedures outlined in this manual.
NOTE: Although Volvo recommends removing the engine and transmission as an assembly, we have found the transmission can be left in the vehicle if desired. If
choosing to remove the engine only and leave the transmission in the vehicle, disregard the transmission, shifter, cables, driveshaft, and mount removal procedures.
In place of these procedures, the bell housing bolts must be removed, as well as the torque converter bolts, if equipped with an automatic transmission. Also, a
floorjack or other suitable support must be placed under the transmission.

The ring gear is contacted by the starter gear during engine start up. If any damage is found on the ring gear (broken or chipped teeth, cracks, etc.) the cause of the failure should be
identified and repaired. The starter should be checked as a possible cause.
On vehicles with automatic transmission, the ring gear is an integral part of the flexplate and cannot be replaced. On vehicles with manual gearboxes, the ring gear on the flywheel can be
removed and replaced. This replacement involves heating the ring to 450°F, and handling the heated ring. It is usually found to be easier to buy a complete flywheel and ring gear assembly
than to attempt the replacement. If you possess the proper equipment for heating and handling the ring gear, the procedure is as follows:
1.

Disconnect the negative battery cable.

2.

Raise and support the vehicle.

3.

Remove the transmission, as described in Section 7.

4.

If equipped with a manual transmission/transaxle, remove the clutch plate and disc.

5.

Remove the bolts attaching the flywheel or ring gear to the crankshaft flange.

6.

Remove the flywheel or ring gear.

7.

Inspect the flywheel for cracks, grooves, or bluing and inspect the ring gear for burrs or worn teeth.

8.

Replace the flywheel or ring gear if any damage is apparent.

9.

Remove burrs with a mill file.

10.

To replace a ring gear, use the following steps.
A.

Use a 10mm bit and drill a hole between two cogs (teeth) on the ring gear, being careful not to drill into the flywheel.

B.

Mount the flywheel in a vise protected by soft jaws and split the ring gear at the hole with a chisel.

C.

Heat the new ring gear to approximately 450°F (232°C). When handling the heated ring, wear heavy gloves and use tongs.

D.

Position the ring gear with the beveled side facing the flywheel.

E.

Use a brass drift and tap the ring gear until flush. Allow to air cool before installation; do not attempt to cool the metal with water, oil or other fluids.

11.

Install the flywheel.

12.

Install the bolts and torque to specification in a crisscross pattern.

13.

Install the transmission, as described in Section 7.

14.

Lower the vehicle.

15.

Connect the negative battery cable.
Fig. 1: The flywheel must be immobilized so that the
retaining bolts can be removed; tool 5112 is being used here

The timing belt should be periodically inspected for wear. Removal of the timing cover is necessary to visually check the belt for signs of wear or contamination. The belt should show no
signs of wear such as cracked teeth, wear on the belt face, wear on one or both sides of the belt, and there should be no foreign materials on the belt or between the teeth. If there is oil,
coolant, lubricant, or any other foreign material on the belt, it is a good idea to replace the belt due to the fact that rapid wear can result from this contamination. Usually sticking to the
manufacturer's guide for timing belt replacement interval will ensure little problems but it is still a good idea to periodically inspect your belt. If the belt breaks the engine will shut down and
serious engine damage can occur. The proper manufacturer recommended timing belt replacement interval can be found in Section 1.
Fig. 1: Check for premature parting of the belt

Remove the belt, taking care not to bend it at any sharp angles. The belt should be replaced at 45,000 mile (72,500 km) intervals, if it becomes oil soaked or frayed or if it is on
a vehicle that has been sitting idle for any length of time.

7.

If the crankshaft, idler shaft or camshaft were disturbed while the belt was out, align each shaft with its corresponding index mark to assure proper valve timing and ignition
timing, as follows:

To install:

A.

Rotate the crankshaft so the notch in the convex crankshaft gear belt guide aligns with the embossed mark on the front cover (12 o'clock position).

B.

Rotate the idler shaft so the dot on the idler shaft drive sprocket aligns with the notch on the timing belt rear cover (4 o'clock position).

C.

Rotate the camshaft so the notch in the camshaft sprocket inner belt guide aligns with the notch in the forward edge of the valve cover (12 o'clock position).

8.

Install the timing belt (don't use any sharp tools) over the sprockets and then over the tensioner roller. Some new belts have yellow marks. The 2 lines on the drive belt should fit
toward the crankshaft marks. The next mark should then fit toward the intermediate shaft marks, etc.

9.

Loosen the tensioner nut and let the spring tension automatically take up the slack. Tighten the tensioner nut to 37 ft. lbs. (51 Nm).

10.

Rotate the crankshaft one full revolution clockwise and make sure the timing marks still align.

11.

Install the drive belts, radiator fan and shroud.

12.

Connect the negative battery cable.

B234F Engine
NOTE: The B234F engine has 2 timing belts, one driving the camshafts and one driving the balance shafts. The camshaft belt may be removed separately; the balance
shaft belt requires removal of the camshaft belt. During reassembly, the exact placement of the belts and pulleys must be observed.
1.

Remove the negative battery cable.

2.

Remove the timing belt covers.

3.

Turn the engine to TDC, of the compression stroke, on cylinder No. 1. Make sure the marks on the cam pulleys align with the marks on the backing plate and that the marking on
the belt guide plate (on the crankshaft) is opposite the TDC mark on the engine block.

4.

Remove the protective cap over the timing belt tensioner locknut. Loosen the locknut, compress the tensioner, to release tension on the belts, and re-tighten the locknut, holding
the tensioner in place.

5.

Remove the timing belt from the camshafts. Do not crease or fold the belt. Place a mark noting the direction of the belt's rotation if you are reinstalling the same belt.

6.

Check the tensioner by spinning it counterclockwise and listening for any bearing noise within. Check also that the belt contact surface is clean and smooth. In the same fashion,
check the timing belt idler pulleys. Make sure the bolts are tightened to 18.5 ft. lbs. (25 Nm).

7.

If the balance shaft belt is to be removed:

NOTE: The camshafts and the crankshaft must not be moved when the belt is removed.

A.

Remove the balance shaft belt idler pulley from the engine.

B.

Loosen the locknut on the tensioner and remove the belt. Slide the belt under the crankshaft pulley assembly. Check the tensioner and idler wheels carefully for
any sign of contamination; check the ends of the shafts for any sign of oil leakage.

C.

Check the position of the balance shafts and the crankshaft after belt removal. The balance shaft markings on the pulleys should align with the markings on the
backing plate and the crankshaft marking should still be aligned with the TDC mark on the engine block.

D.

When refitting the balance shaft belt, observe that the belt has colored dots on it. These marks assist in the critical placement of the belt. The yellow dot will align
the right lower shaft, the blue dot will align on the crank and the other yellow dot will match to the upper left balance shaft.

E.

Carefully work the belt in under the crankshaft pulley. Make sure the blue dot is opposite the bottom (TDC) marking on the belt guide plate at the bottom of the
crankshaft. Fit the belt around the left upper balance shaft pulley, making sure the yellow mark is opposite the mark on the pulley. Install the belt around the right
lower balance shaft pulley and again check that the mark on the belt aligns with the mark on the pulley.

F.

Work the belt around the tensioner. Double check that all the markings are still aligned.

G.

Set the belt tension by inserting an Allen key into the adjusting hole in the tensioner. Turn the crankshaft carefully through a few degrees on either side of TDC to
check that the belt has properly engaged the pulleys. Return the crank to the TDC position and set the adjusting hole just below the 3 o'clock position when
tightening the adjusting bolt. Use the Allen wrench, in the adjusting hole, as a counter hold and tighten the locking bolt to 29.5 ft. lbs. (40 Nm).

H.

Check the tension of the belt. If the belt is out of specification, the belt must be readjusted.
To install:

8.

Reinstall the camshaft belt by aligning the double line marking on the belt with the top marking on the belt guide plate at the top of the crankshaft. Stretch the belt around the
crank pulley and place it over the tensioner and the right side idler. Place the belt on the camshaft pulleys. The single line marks on the belt should align exactly with the pulley
markings. Route the belt around the oil pump drive pulley and press the belt onto the left side idler.

9.

Check that all the markings align and that the engine is still positioned at TDC, of the compression stroke, for cylinder No. 1.

10.

Loosen the tensioner locknut.

11.

Turn the crankshaft clockwise. The cam pulleys should rotate 1 full turn until the marks again align with the marks on the backing plate.

12.

Smoothly rotate the crankshaft further clockwise until the cam pulley markings are 1 1 ⁄ 2 teeth beyond the marks on the backing plate.

13.

Tighten the tensioner locknut.

14.

Check the tension on the balance shaft belt; it should now be 3.8 units. If the tension is too low, adjust the tensioner clockwise. If the tension is too high, repeat Step 7g.

15.

Check the belt guide for the balance shaft belt and make sure it is properly seated.

16.

Install the center timing belt cover, the one that covers the tensioner, the fan shroud, fan pulley and fan.

17.

Install all the drive belts and connect the battery cable.

18.

Double check all installation items, paying particular attention to loose hoses or hanging wires, untightened nuts, poor routing of hoses and wires (too tight or rubbing) and tools left
in the engine area.

NOTE: The engine must not be rotated counterclockwise during this procedure.

19.

Connect the negative battery cable.

20.

Start the engine and allow it to run until the thermostat opens.
CAUTION
The upper and lower timing belt covers are still removed. The belt and pulleys are exposed and moving at high speed.

21.

Turn the engine OFF and bring the engine to TDC, of the compression stroke, on cylinder No. 1.

22.

Disconnect the negative battery cable.

23.

Check the tension of the camshaft belt. Position the gauge between the right (exhaust) cam pulley and the idler. Belt tension must be 5.5 plus or minus 0.2 units. If the belt needs
adjustment, remove the rubber cap over the tensioner locknut, cap is located on the timing belt cover, and loosen the locknut.

24.

Insert a suitable tool between the tensioner wheel and the spring carrier pin to hold the tensioner. If the belt needs to be tightened, move the roller to adjust the tension to 6.0 units.
If the belt is too tight, adjust to obtain a reading of 5.0 units on the gauge. Tighten the tensioner locknut.

25.

Rotate the crankshaft so the cam pulleys move through 1 full revolution and recheck the tension on the camshaft belt. It should now be 5.5 plus or minus 0.2 units. Install the
plastic plug over the tensioner bolt.

26.

Final check the tension on the balance shaft belt by fitting the gauge and turning the tensioner clockwise. Only small movements are needed. After any needed readjustments,
rotate the crankshaft clockwise through 1 full revolution and recheck the balance shaft belt. The tension should now be on the final specification of 4.9 plus or minus 0.2 units.

27.

Install the idler pulley for the balance shaft belt.

28.

Reinstall the upper and lower timing belt covers.

29.

Connect the negative battery cable.
