Important
Before you operate your car for the first time, please familiarize yourself with the BREAK-IN
information on page 4:1. You should also be familiar with the information in the first three chapters of
this book.
Information contained in the balance of the manual is extremely useful and should be studied after
operating the vehicle for the first time. This manual is structured so that it can be used for reference. It
should thus be kept in the car for ready access.
Do not export your Volvo to another country before investigating the country's applicable safety and
exhaust emission requirements. In some cases it may be difficult or impossible to comply with these
requirements. Modifications to the emission control system(s) may render your Volvo not certifiable for
legal operation in the U.S., Canada or other countries.
All information, illustrations and specifications contained in this manual are based on the latest product
information available at the time of publication. Volvo reserves the right to make model changes at any
time, or to change specifications or design, without notice and without incurring obligation.

from (P)ark.
If it is necessary to manually override the Shiftlock system, see page 6:18 for instructions.
KEYLOCK:
This means that when you switch off the ignition, the gear selector must be in the (P)ark position before the starting (ignition) key can be
removed from the ignition switch.
ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS):
The ABS system in your car performs a self-diagnostic test when the vehicle is started and at 4 mph (6 km/h). The driver may detect one

pg. 1:4 Warning lights

The warning lights described on pages 1:4 and 1:5 should never stay on when driving
When the ignition key is turned on, and before the engine starts, all of the warning lights should be on to test the function of the bulbs.
Should a light not go off after the engine has started, the system indicated should be inspected. However, the parking brake reminder light
will not go off until the parking brake is fully released.

Generator warning light
If the light comes on while the engine is running, check the tension of the generator drive belt as soon as possible.

Malfunction indicator lamp
If the lamp comes on (or stays on after the vehicle has started), the engine diagnostic system has detected a possible fault in the emission
control system. Although driveability may not be affected, see an authorized Volvo retailer as soon as possible for inspection.

Oil pressure warning light
If the light comes on while driving, the oil pressure is too low. Stop the car and then stop the engine immediately and check the engine oil
level. See the section titled "Engine oil". If the light stays on after restart, have the car towed to the nearest authorized Volvo retailer. After
hard driving, the light may come on occasionally when the engine is idling. This is normal, provided it goes off when the engine speed is
increased.

Parking brake reminder light
This light will be on when the parking brake (hand brake) is applied. The parking brake lever is situated between the front seats. Canadian
models are equipped with this warning light:

Brake fluid warning light
If the light comes on while driving or braking, this indicates that the brake fluid level is too low.
Stop immediately, open the hood and check the brake fluid level in the reservoir (see section "Engine compartment" for reservoir
position)!
Canadian models are equipped with this warning light:
WARNING!
If the level is below the MIN mark in either section of the reservoir: DO NOT DRIVE. Tow the car to a Volvo retailer and have the
brake system checked and any leakage repaired.
pg. 1:5 Indicator lights

Service reminder indicator
This light will come on at 10,000 mile (16,000 km) intervals. It is a reminder to the driver that the 10,000 mile (16,000 km) service
interval has been exceeded. The light will stay on 2 minutes after the start until reset by the servicing dealer.
* Turbo models: 5,000 miles (8,000 km)

Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)
If the warning lamp lights up there is a malfunction of the ABS system (the standard braking system will however function). The vehicle
should be driven to a Volvo retailer for inspection.
See page 4:15 for additional information.
Canadian models are equipped with this warning light:

Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)
If the light comes on (or stays on after the vehicle has started), the SRS diagnostic system has detected a fault. Drive to an authorized
Volvo retailer for an inspection of the system. See the SRS section for more information.

pg. 1:11 Heating, ventilation and air conditioning

Heating and air conditioning
Your Volvo is equipped with a heating system combined with air conditioning.
Depending on which function you select, warm or cool/cold air is distributed to the different parts of the
passenger compartment.
The air conditioning system in your car contains a CFC-refrigerant - R134a. This substance will not
deplete the ozone layer. Volvo cares about the environment. The system contains 2.1 lbs (0.95 kg)
R134a and uses Seiko-Seiki SK 20 (type PAG) oil.

Air louvers (dash)
A Open
B Closed

C Directing air flow horizontally
D Directing air flow vertically
A certain amount of air will always enter through the dash air louvers as long as they are open,
independent of the position of the air distribution control.
Close the dash air louvers to obtain maximum air flow to floor or windshield.

Operating tips
The air conditioning system functions only at temperatures above 43°F (6°C).
The air conditioning will only function if the blower is set to position 1 or higher.

Choose this position if the outside air is contaminated with exhaust gases, smoke, etc or to heat/
cool the car quickly. In this position, very little air is drawn into the passenger compartment from the
outside. Do not leave the system in this mode for more than 10-15 minutes since the air inside the car
will become stale. The temperature can be controlled with the temperature dial.
Remember: If the panel vents are open, a certain amount of air will always flow through, regardless of
the position the function dial is in. To increase the flow of air to either the floor or the windows, close
the panel vents. The outer vents can be opened to avoid mist on the side windows.
The air conditioning system will function best if it is used regularly.
Water under the vehicle in hot weather can be the result of condensation from the air conditioning
system.

The heated front seats can be switched on and off as required. When switched on, the system senses the
ambient temperature and regulates the level of heat applied. When the optimum temperature is reached,
the heating is switched off automatically.
While driving, the passenger seat heating should be switched off when the seat is not occupied.
pg. 1:15 Electrically operated windows

The electrically operated windows are controlled by switches from the driver's armrest as shown in the
above illustration.
The starting (ignition) switches must be ON (position II) for the electrically operated windows to
function. The window is lowered if the rear part of the switch is pressed and raised if the front part of the
switch is pressed.
WARNING! Remove the starting (ignition) key when children are left unattended in the
vehicle.
Make sure that children's hands are clear before raising the windows.

The FM waves do not follow the earth's surface nor do they bounce off the atmosphere. For this reason
their range is limited.
The AM waves follow the earth's surface and reflect against the atmosphere, giving them a wide range.

Weak reception (fading)
Because of the limited range of the FM senders and the fact that these waves are very reflective, this
problem usually occurs with FM reception. If the sender is blocked by buildings or mountains, static can
result.

Static
The reason why FM but not AM is audible is covered parking areas, under bridges, etc., is that FM
signals reflect against solid objects such as buildings. Because these waves are very reflective, static can
result. This static is the result of the reflected signal and the direct signal reaching your antenna at
slightly different times causing a cancellation of all signals. This problem occurs largely in built-up
areas.

Cross modulation
If you listen to a weak station in the vicinity of a stronger one, both stations may be received
simultaneously.

FM - reasons for distortion
FM is affected by the electrical systems of nearby vehicles, especially those without suppression. The
distortion increases if the station is weak or poorly set.
The FM reception is not as sensitive to electrical disturbances as AM.

AM - reasons for distortion
AM reception is sensitive to electrical disturbances such as power lines, lighting, etc.
pg. 1:29 Radio

FM stereo reception
Stereo reception places very high demands on the signal quality which means the type of distortions
previously mentioned become even more obvious. The signal strength needs to be stronger for good
stereo reception and this limits the effective range of the sender.
We hope that this information proves to be useful and provides you with a better understanding of the
problems related to car radio reception.
Reception conditions are not always optimum and this is, of course, beyond our control. However, we
have endeavored to make the Volvo Audio System of a quality that will enable you to enjoy the best
possible reception no matter what the reception conditions may be.
Radio antenna (sedans)
NOTE: Always lower the antenna (by switching off the radio) when using an automatic car wash or
entering a garage.
The antenna should be cleaned at least every 10,000 miles (16,000 km) or more frequently if needed.

1995 Volvo 940

Use WD40 for cleaning.
Spray the antenna with WD40 and wipe it clean and dry with a rag. Spray it again. Lower and raise the
antenna. Wipe it clean and dry again. Lower and raise the antenna 4-6 times. Make sure it is dry and free
from dirt or lubricating oil.
Radio antenna (wagons)
The radio antenna is built into the driver side window of the cargo area. This antenna also has a factory
installed antenna booster.
NOTE: The antenna will not work without this booster.
Place objects in the cargo area so that the antenna wires on the inside of the window will not be
damaged. When cleaning the window be careful that the wires are not scratched by rings, etc. If they are
damaged, radio reception will be impaired.
pg. 1:30 Technical specifications

Cleaning of magnetic head In order to maintain the best possible sound quality and to ensure troublefree
operation, Volvo recommends the use of Volvo Cleaning Cassette (available from your Volvo dealer) at
regular intervals (10 to 15 hrs).
Cassettes/Compact Discs
● Store cassettes/discs in their cases.
● Do not touch the tape/disc surface with your fingers.
● Cassettes/discs should not be exposed to direct sunlight or extreme temperatures.
● Keep cassettes/discs away from oil, grease and other contaminants.
● For optimal tape deck performance Volvo does not recommend the use of C-120 tapes.
● Take up tape slack using a pen or a pencil before inserting a cassette.
● Never play a damaged disc. This may cause CD changer break-down.

3:11 Reporting Safety Defects
Despite our strongest recommendations, and your best intentions, not wearing a seat belt is like
believing "It'll never happen to me!". Volvo urges you and all adult occupants of your car to wear seat
belts and ensure that children are properly restrained, using an infant, car or booster seat determined by
age, weight and height.
Fact: In every state and province, some type of child-restraint legislation has been passed. Additionally,
most states and provinces have already made it mandatory for occupants of a car to use seat belts.
So, urging you to "buckle up" is not just our recommendation - legislation in your state or province may
mandate seat belt usage. The few seconds it takes to buckle up may one day allow you to say, "It's a
good thing I was wearing my seat belt".
pg. 3:2 Seat belts

Seat belts

Always fasten the seat belts before you drive or ride.
Two lights above the rear view mirror will be illuminated for 4-8 seconds after the starting (ignition) key
is turned to the driving position. One light is located in the instrument panel and one in the console
between the front seats.
A chime will sound at the same time if the driver has not fastened his seat belt. The rear seats are
provided with self-retracting inertia reel belts. The front seats are provided with single roller belts with
tensioners.

1995 Volvo 940

To buckle:
Pull the belt out far enough to insert the latch plate into the receptacle (buckle for rear seats) until a
distinct snapping sound is heard. The seat belt retractor is normally "unlocked" and you can move freely,
provided that the shoulder belt is not pulled out too far. The retractor will lock up as follows:
●
●
●
●

if the belt is pulled out rapidly
during braking and acceleration
if the vehicle is leaning excessively
when driving in turns

In order for the seat belt to provide maximum protection in the event of an accident, it must be worn
correctly. When wearing remember:
● The belt should not be twisted or turned.
● The lap belt must be positioned low on the hips (not pressing against the abdomen). Make sure that
the shoulder belt is rolled up into its retractor and that the shoulder and lap belts are taut.

1995 Volvo 940

Before exiting the car, check that the seat belt retracts fully after being unbuckled. If necessary, guide
the belt back into the retractor slot.
WARNING! Any device used to induce slack into the shoulder belt portion of the three-point belt
system will have a detrimental effect on the amount of protection available to you in the event of a
collision. The seat back should not be tilted too far back. The shoulder belt must be taut in order to
function properly.

Rear head restraint
The center head restraint can be adjusted according to the passenger's height. The restraints should be
carefully adjusted to support the occupant's head.

During pregnancy
Pregnant women should always wear seat belts. Remember that the belt should always be positioned in
such a way as to avoid any possible pressure on the abdomen. The lap portion of the belt should be
located low, as shown in the above illustration.

1995 Volvo 940

WARNING! Never use a seat belt for more than one occupant. Never wear the shoulder portion of the
belt under the arm, behind the back or otherwise out of position. Such use could cause injury in event
of accident. As the seat belts lose much of their strength when exposed to violent stretching, they
should be replaced after any collision, even though they may appear to be undamaged. Never repair
the belt on your own; have this done by an authorized Volvo dealer only.
pg. 3:4 Volvo SRS

As an enhancement to the three-point seat belt system, your Volvo is equipped with a Supplemental
Restraint System (SRS). The Volvo SRS consists of airbags (2) and knee bolsters (5) on both the driver's
and passenger's sides and seat belt tensioners in both front door pillars (4). The system is designed to
supplement the protection provided by the three-point seat belt system.
The SRS system is indicated by the "SRS" embossed on the steering wheel pad and above the glove
compartment, the knee bolsters beneath the steering column and the glove compartment and decals on
both sun visors and on the far right side of the dash.
The airbags are folded and located in the center of the steering wheel and above the glove compartment.
They are designed to deploy during certain frontal-angular collisions, impacts, or decelerations,
depending on the crash severity, angle, speed and object impacted. Both air bags and seat belt tensioners
will deploy, even if the passenger seat is not occupied.
WARNING!
As its name implies, SRS is designed to be a SUPPLEMENT to - not a replacement for - the threepoint belt system. For maximum protection, wear seat belts at all times. Be aware that no system can
prevent all possible injuries that may occur in an accident.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_3_1.html (5 of 11)12/30/2006 9:54:36 AM

1995 Volvo 940

The airbag system includes gas generators (1) surrounded by the airbags (2) and front seat belt
tensioners for both of the front seats (4). To deploy the system, the sensor (3) activates the gas
generators causing the airbags to be inflated with nitrogen gas. As the movement of the seat's occupants
compresses the airbags, some of the gas is expelled at a controlled rate to provide better cushioning.
Both seat belt tensioners also deploy, minimizing any seat belt slack.
The entire process, including inflation and deflation of the airbags, takes approximately two-tenths of a
second.
WARNING!
When installing any optional equipment make sure that the SRS system is not damaged. Do not
attempt to service any component of the SRS yourself. Attempting to do so may result in serious
personal injury. If a problem arises, take your car to the nearest authorized Volvo Retailer for
inspection as soon as possible.

1995 Volvo 940

A self-diagnostic system incorporated in the sensor monitors the SRS. If a fault is detected, the "SRS"
warning light will illuminate. The light is included in the warning/indicator light cluster in the
instrument panel. Normally, the SRS warning lamp should light up when the ignition is switched on and
should go out after 10 seconds or when the engine is started. Check that this light is functioning properly
every time the car is started.
The following items are monitored by all the self-diagnostic system:
● Sensor unit
● Cable harness
● Gas generator ignitor
WARNING! Never drive an SRS equipped car with your hands on the steering wheel pad/airbag
housing.

WARNING! If the SRS warning light stays on after the engine has started or if it comes on while you
are driving, drive the car to the nearest authorized Volvo retailer for inspection as soon as possible.

There is no maintenance to perform on the SRS yourself. The only periodic maintenance recommended
on the SRS is that the air bag modules and front seat belts (including tensioners) should be replaced
approximately every ten years and that the other components in the system (wiring, connectors, etc.)
should also be inspected at this time. The SRS decal on your car shows the month and year servicing is
due. This service must be performed by an authorized Volvo dealer. Should you have any questions

WARNING! Do not use child safety seats or child boosters cushions/backrests in the front passenger's
seat. We also recommend that children who have outgrown these devices sit in the rear seat with the
seat belt properly fastened.

NOTE: Deployment of SRS components occurs only one time during an accident. In a collision where
deployment occurs, the air bags and seat belt tensioners activate. Some noise occurs and a small
amount of powder is released. The release of the powder may appear as smoke-like matter. This is a
normal characteristic and does not indicate fire.

WARNING!
Occupants in the front passenger's seat must never sit on the edge of the seat, sit leaning toward the
instrument panel or otherwise sit out of position. The occupant's back must be as upright as comfort
allows and be against the seat back with the seat properly fastened.
● Feet must be on the floor, e.g. not on the dash, seat or out of the window.
● Children must never be allowed to stand in front of the passenger seat.
● No objects or accessory equipment, e.g. dash covers, may be placed on, attached to or installed near
the SRS hatch (the area above the glove compartment) or the area affected by air bag deployment (see
illustration).
● There should be no loose articles, e.g. coffee cups, on the floor, seat or dash area.
● Never try to open the SRS cover on the steering wheel or the passenger side SRS hatch. This should
only be done by an authorized Volvo service technician.

Failure to follow these instructions can result in injury to the vehicle occupants in an accident.

pg. 3:7 Volvo SRS

When are the airbags deployed?
The SRS system is designed to deploy during certain frontal or front-angular collisions, impacts, or
decelerations, depending in the crash severity, angle, speed, and object impacted. The SRS sensor is
designed to react to both the impact of the collision and the inertial forces generated by it and to
determine if the intensity of the collision is sufficient for the airbags to be deployed.
NOTE: The SRS system activates only once in a collision.
If the airbags have been deployed, we recommend the following:
● Have the car towed to an authorized Volvo retailer. Even if it can be driven after an accident we do
not recommend driving the car with deployed airbags.
● Have an authorized Volvo retailer replace the SRS system components.
● Use only new, Genuine Volvo Parts when replacing SRS components (airbags, seat belts, tensioners,
etc.)
When are the airbags NOT deployed?
Not all frontal collisions activate the SRS system. If the collision involves a non-rigid object (e.g., a
snow drift or bush), or a rigid, fixed object at a low speed, the SRS system will not necessarily deploy.
Airbags do not normally deploy in a side impact collision, in a collision from the rear or in a rollover
situation. The amount of damage to the bodywork does not reliably indicate if the airbags should have
deployed or not.
Can the airbags deploy accidentally?
The SRS system is designed to deploy during certain frontal or front-angular collisions, impacts, or
decelerations, depending on the crash severity, angle, speed and object impacted. The SRS system has
its own diagnostic unit which continuously monitors and inspects the system. Make a habit of checking
the SRS system warning light when starting and driving the car. Normally, this light will come on when
the ignition is switched on and should go out after approximately 10 seconds or when the engine is
started. If this light should stay on or come on while you are driving, drive the car to an authorized
Volvo retailer for inspection as soon as possible.
Seat belts - the heart of the Volvo safety system

1995 Volvo 940

The heart of the Volvo safety system is the three-point seat belt! In order for the SRS system to provide
the protection intended, seat belts must be worn at all times by everyone in the car. The SRS system is a
supplement to the seat belts.
WARNING! If your car has been subjected to flood conditions (e.g. soaked carpeting/standing water
on the floor of the vehicle) or if your car has become flood-damaged in any way, do not attempt to
start the vehicle or put the key in the ignition before disconnecting the battery (see below). This may
cause airbag deployment which could result in personal injury. Have the car towed to an authorized
Volvo dealer for repairs.
Automatic transmission only:
Before attempting to tow the car, use the following procedure to override the shiftlock system to move
the gear selector to the neutral position.

Child Restraint Anchorages
Volvo cars are fitted with Child Restraint Top Tether Anchorages in the rear seat. There are three
anchorages under the rear section of the car's rear window shelf on sedans and on the back rest on
wagons. The backrest on wagons must be folded down slightly to reach the anchorages. When the car is
delivered, the holes for these anchorages are covered by plastic covers. In cars designated for Canada,
one top tether anchorage set will be in the glove box.
The top tether anchorage set includes the top tether anchorage plate, an 5/16" UNC bolt and a plastic
trim cover. If another set is needed, consult your Volvo retailer.
Installing the top tether
Remove the plastic cover on the anchorage point you want to use. This can be done with a suitable coin.
The cover is removed counter-clockwise. Refer to the child seat manufacturer's instructions for securing
the seat. An additional bolt may be required for sedans. This may be obtained from your authorized
Volvo dealer.

WARNING! Child Restraint Anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by
correctly fitted Child Restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used for adult seat belts or
harnesses. The anchorages are not able to withstand excessive forces on them in the event of collision
if full harness seat belts or adult seat belts are installed to them. An adult who uses a belt anchored in a
Child Restraint Anchorage runs a great risk of suffering severe injuries should a collision occur. Do
not install rear speakers which would require the removal of the top tether anchors or interfere with the
proper use of the top tether strap.

Integrated booster cushion (certain models)
Volvo's own integrated booster cushion has been specially designed to help safeguard a child seated in
the center position of the rear seat. When using the integrated booster cushion, the child must be secured
with the vehicle's three-point seat belt. The booster cushion is approved for children weighing between
22.7 and 36 kg (50 and 80 lbs) and between 117 and 137 cm (46 and 54 in ) in height. It is not intended
for children under 3 years of age.
Sedans (certain models) - alt.1
With the child properly seated on the booster cushion (see illustration), adjust the head restraint to
support the child's head (see page 3:3). The hip section of the three-point seat belt must fit snugly across
the child's hips, not across the stomach.
The shoulder section of the three-point seat belt should be positioned across the chest and shoulder (see
illustration). The shoulder belt must never be placed behind the child's back or under the arm.

consult your Volvo dealer.
pg. 3:10 Child safety (cont.)

Child safety
Volvo recommends the proper use of restraint systems for all occupants including children. Remember
that, regardless of age and size, a child should always be properly restrained in a car.
Restraint systems for children are designed to be secured in the vehicle by lap belts or the lap portion of
a lap-shoulder belt. Such child restraint systems can help protect children in cars in the event of an
accident only if they are used properly. However, children could be endangered in a crash if the child
restraints are not properly secured in the vehicle. Failure to follow the installation instructions for your
child restraint can result in your child striking the vehicle's interior in a sudden stop.
Holding a child in your arms is NOT a suitable substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, a
child held in a person's arms can be crushed between the vehicle's interior and an unrestrained person.
The child could also be injured by striking the interior, or by being ejected from the vehicle during a
sudden maneuver or impact. The same can also happen if the infant or child rides unrestrained on the
seat. Other occupants should also be properly restrained to help reduce the chance of injuries or
increasing the injury of a child. All states and provinces have legislation governing how and where
children should be carried in car. Find out the regulations existing in your state or province. Recent
accident statistics have shown that children are safer in rear seating positions than front seating positions
when properly restrained. A child restraint system can help protect a child in a vehicle. Here's what to
look for when selecting a child restraint system:
● It should have a label certifying that it meets applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
(FMVSS 213-80) - or in Canada, CMVSS 213.
● Make sure the child restraint system is approved for the child's height, weight and development - the
label required by the standard or regulation, or instructions for infant restraints, typically provide this
information.
● In using any child restraint system, we urge you to look carefully over the instructions that are
provided with the restraint. Be sure you understand them and can use the device properly and safely in
this vehicle. A misused child restraint system can result in increased injuries for both the infant or child
and other occupants in the vehicle.

1995 Volvo 940

If your child restraint requires a top tether strap, consult your authorized Volvo dealer for top tether
anchorage and installation information.

●

When a child has outgrown the child safety seat, you should use the rear seat with the standard seat belt
fastened. The best way to help protect the child here is to place the child on a cushion (not available in
Canada) so that the seat belt is properly located on the hips (see previous page).
A specially designed and tested booster cushion for children between 22.7 - 36 kg (50 - 80 lbs) and 117 137 cm (46 - 54") can be obtained from your Volvo dealer.
If necessary, an auxiliary seat for children is available for use in the luggage compartment of station
wagon models. This seat is designed for two children, each weighing between 23 - 40 kg (50 - 88 lbs.)
and up to 150 cm (59 inches) in height.
WARNING!
Do not use a booster cushion or child seat in conjunction with the auxiliary
seat.
pg. 3:11 Occupant safety

Seat belt maintenance
Check periodically that the anchor bolts are secure and that the belts are in good condition. Use water
and a mild detergent for cleaning. Check seat belt mechanism function as follows:
Attach the seat belt and pull rapidly on the strap.
WARNING! Check other traffic before performing the following
check.

Brake firmly from approximately 30 mph (50 km/h) or turn in a tight circle while pulling on the belt.
In the above checks you should not be able to pull the belt out.
Volvo Concern for Safety
Safety is the cornerstone for Volvo. Our concern dates back to 1927 when the first Volvo rolled off the
production line. Three-point seat belts, safety cages, and energy-absorbing impact zones were designed
into Volvo cars long before it was fashionable or required by government regulation. We will not
compromise our commitment to safety. We continue to seek out new safety features and to refine those
already in our cars. You can help. We would appreciate hearing your suggestions about improving
automobile safety. We also want to know if you ever have a safety concern with your car.

Occupant safety
How safely you drive doesn't depend on how old you are but rather on:
● how well you see
● your ability to concentrate
● how quickly you make decisions under stress to avoid an accident.
The tips listed below are suggestions to help you cope with the ever changing traffic environment.
● Never drink and drive.
● If you are taking any medication, consult your physician about its potential effects on your driving
abilities.
● Take a driver-retraining course
● Have your eyes checked regularly
● Keep your windshield and headlamps clean.
● Replace wiper blades when they start to leave streaks.
● Take into account the traffic, road, and water conditions, particularly with regard to stopping distance.
Reporting Safety Defects in the U.S.
If you believe that your vehicle has a defect which could cause a crash or could cause injury or death,
you should immediately inform the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in
addition to notifying Volvo Cars of North America. If NHTSA receives similar complaints, it may open
an investigation, and if it finds that a safety defect exists in a group of vehicles, it may order a recall and
remedy campaign. However, NHTSA cannot become involved in individual problems between you,
your retailer, or Volvo Cars of North America. To contact NHTSA, you may either call the Auto Safety
Hotline toll-free at 1-800-424-9393 (or 366-0123 in Washington, D.C. area) or write to: NHSTA, U.S.

To obtain best parking brake performance, the brake linings should be broken-in. Stop 5-7 times from 30
mph (50 km/h), transmission in neutral, applying the parking brake with the release button pressed in
during the stop.
The force must not lock the rear wheels. If this happens, release the brake enough to let the wheels
rotate. Drive a mile between each stop to cool the brakes. Check for proper parking brake operation.
WARNING! The brake lights are not illuminated when applying the parking brake. To warn traffic
from it is therefore advisable to depress the brake pedal slightly to illuminate the brake lights. Never
perform this procedure on a wet or slippery road in traffic.
pg. 4:2 Fuel requirements, Refueling

Unleaded Fuel
Each Volvo has a three-way catalytic converter and must use only unleaded gasoline. U.S. and Canadian
regulations require that pumps delivering unleaded gasoline be labeled "UNLEADED". Only these
pumps have nozzles which fit your car's filler inlet. It is unlawful to dispense leaded fuel into a vehicle
labeled "unleaded gasoline only". Leaded gasoline damages the three-way catalytic converter and the
heated oxygen sensor system. Repeated use of leaded gasoline will lessen the effectiveness of the
emission control system and could result in loss of emission warranty coverage. State and local vehicle
inspection programs will make detection of misfueling easier, possibly resulting in emission test failure
for misfueled vehicles.
Octane Rating
Volvo engines are designed for optimum performance on unleaded premium gasoline with an octane
rating, AKI of 91, or above. AKI (ANTI KNOCK INDEX) is an average of the Research Octane
Number, RON, and the Motor Octane Number, MON, (RON + MON/ 2).
The minimum octane requirement is AKI 87 (RON 91).
Gasoline Containing Alcohol and Ethers
"Oxygenated fuels"
Some fuel suppliers sell gasoline containing "oxygenates" which are usually alcohols or ethers. In some
areas, state or local laws require that the service pump be marked indicating use of alcohol or ethers.
However, there are areas in which the pumps are unmarked. If you are not sure whether there is alcohol
or ethers in the gasoline you buy, check with the service station operator. To meet seasonal air quality
restrictions, some states require the use of "oxygenated" fuel in certain areas.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_4_1.html (2 of 11)12/30/2006 9:54:38 AM

1995 Volvo 940

Volvo allows the use of the following "oxygenated fuels"; however, the octane ratings listed on this page
must still be met.
Alcohol -- Ethanol
Fuels containing up to 10% ethanol by volume may be used.
Ethanol may also be referred to as Ethyl alcohol, or "Gasohol".
Ethers -- MTBE
Fuels containing up to 15% MTBE may be used.
Refueling
The fuel tank filler cap is located behind the door on the left rear fender. Open cap slowly during hot
weather conditions.
When filling, position the cap in the special bracket on the door.
After filling the tank, install the cap and turn until a "click" is heard.
The fuel tank is designed to hold approximately 19.8 US gals (75 liters) with sufficient volume left over
to accommodate possible expansion of the fuel in hot weather. Be aware that the "usable" tank capacity
will be somewhat less than the 19.8 US gallons (75 liters) maximum. When the fuel level is low, such
factors as ambient temperature, the fuel's "vapor pressure" characteristics, and terrain can affect the fuel
pumps' ability to supply the engine with an adequate supply of fuel. Therefore, it is advisable to refuel as
soon as possible when the needle nears the red zone, or when the fuel warning light comes on.
CAUTION: Take care not to spill gasoline during refueling. Gasolines containing alcohol can cause
damage to painted surfaces, which may not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.
Do not use gasoline containing methanol (methyl alcohol, wood alcohol). This practice can result in
vehicle performance deterioration and can damage critical parts in the fuel system. Such damage may
not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.
pg. 4:3 Driving economy, Carbon deposits

Economical driving does not necessarily mean driving slowly
Better driving economy may be obtained by thinking ahead, avoiding rapid starts and stops and
adjusting the speed of your vehicle to immediate traffic conditions. Observe the following rules:
Bring the engine to normal operating temperature as soon as possible by driving with a light foot on
the accelerator pedal for the first minutes of operation. A cold engine uses more fuel and is subject to
increased wear.
● Whenever possible, avoid using the car for driving short distances. This does not allow the engine to
reach normal operating temperature.
● Drive carefully and avoid rapid acceleration and hard braking.
●

Do not exceed speed limit.
Avoid carrying unnecessary items (extra load) in the car.
Check tire pressure regularly (check when tires are cold).
Remove snow tires when threat of snow or ice has ended.
Note that roof racks, ski racks, etc., increase air resistance and thereby fuel consumption.
Turbo: try to keep the boost pressure gauge in the black range.
Utilize overdrive at speeds above approx. 45 mph (70 km/h)
Avoid using automatic transmission kick-down feature unless necessary.

Other factors which decrease gas mileage are:
● Worn or dirty spark plugs
● Incorrect spark plug gap
● Dirty air cleaner
● Incorrect valve clearance
● Dirty engine oil and clogged oil filter
● Dragging brakes
● Incorrect front end alignment
● Low tire pressure
Some of the above mentioned items and others are checked at the standard Maintenance Service
intervals.
Deposit control gasoline
Volvo recommends the use of gasoline containing deposit control additives. These additives have shown
to be efficient in keeping injectors and intake valves clean. Consistent use of deposit control gasolines
will help ensure good driveability and fuel economy. If you are not sure whether the gasoline contains
deposit control additives, check with the service station operator.
Note:
Do not add additives yourself to the gasoline, unless you are recommended to do so by an authorized
Volvo dealer.
pg. 4:4 Starting the engine, Turbo caution

Starting and stopping a car equipped with automatic transmission
1 Fasten the seat belt.

1995 Volvo 940

WARNING! Before starting, check that the seat is adjusted properly. Make sure the brake pedal can be
depressed completely. Move the seat closer if necessary. Refer to section "Front seats".

2 Apply the parking brake, if not already set. The gear selector is locked in the (P)ark position
(SHIFTLOCK).
3 Without touching the accelerator pedal , turn the ignition key to the starting position. Allow the starter
to operate for 5-10 seconds. Release the key as soon as the engine starts. If the engine fails to start,
repeat step 3.
Turbo only : For cold starts at altitudes above 6000 ft (1800 m), depress the accelerator pedal halfway
and turn the key to the starting position. Release the accelerator pedal slowly when the engine starts.
4 To release the gear selector, depress the brake pedal . See page 6:18 for instructions on manually
overriding the SHIFTLOCK system if the lever cannot be moved. Do not race a cold engine
immediately after starting. Oil flow may not reach some lubricating points fast enough to prevent engine
damage.
5 Select desired gear. The gear engages after a slight delay, especially noticeable when selecting R.
CAUTION: Engine should be idling; never accelerate until after you feel the gear engage! Too rapid
acceleration immediately after selecting a gear will cause harsh engagement and premature
transmission wear.

NOTE: Your car is equipped with a KEYLOCK switch system. When the engine is switched off, the
gear selector must be in the (P)ark position before the key can be removed from the ignition switch.

WARNING!
Never leave car unattended with engine running.
Always open the garage doors fully before starting the engine inside a garage to ensure adequate
ventilation. The exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide, which is invisible and odorless but very
poisonous.

1995 Volvo 940

WARNING!
Always place gear selector securely in Park, and apply parking brake before leaving vehicle. Never
leave car unattended with engine running.

Turbo caution
Never race the engine immediately after starting. Oil flow may not reach some lubricating points fast
enough to prevent engine damage.
Do not race the engine just prior to switching off!
pg. 4:5 Automatic transmission

The following "Special Tips" apply to cars with automatic transmission
For steep hills and when driving for prolonged periods at low speed position 1should be selected.
Avoid, however, repeated changes since this can cause overheating of the transmission oil. For driving
on mountain roads with long persistent uphill gradients, select position 2.
● When negotiating long, steep downhill slopes, position 1 or 2 should be selected, in order to obtain
the best possible engine braking effect.
● Do not hold the car stationary on an incline by using the accelerator pedal; instead, engage the parking
brake. This prevents unnecessary heating of the transmission oil.
● When towing, prepare as follows:
Disengage the 4th gear (the indicator light on the instrument panel goes on).
●

Engine warm-up - initial driving procedure
Experience shoes that engines in vehicles driven short distances are subject to abnormally-rapid wear
because the engine never reaches normal operating temperature. It is therefore beneficial to reach normal
operating temperature as soon as possible. This is best achieved by driving with a light foot on the
accelerator pedal for a few minutes after starting, rather than prolonged idling.

1995 Volvo 940

WARNING!
Never leave the car when the engine is running. If, by mistake, the gear selector is moved from P, the
car may start moving.

The gear selector is locked in the P position - SHIFT-LOCK.
To release the selector, start the engine and depress the brake pedal. See section 6:18 for instructions
on manually releasing the gear selector.

R (Reverse)
Never engage R while is moving forward.
N (Neutral)
Neutral position = no gear is engaged. The engine can be started in this position. Use parking brake.
Driving gears
D (Drive)
D is the normal driving position. Upshifts and downshifts of the forward gears occur automatically and
are governed by accelerator pedal position and vehicle speed.
Lock-up
With the gear selector in position D (Drive) the lockup device disengages the torque converter at speeds
above approx. 47-56 mph (75-90 km/h). It provides lowered engine speeds and improved mileage.
The lockup engagement may be noticed as an extra upshift when accelerating.
pg. 4:7 Automatic transmission (cont.)

2 (intermediate position)
Upshifts and downshifts of first two gears (low and intermediate) occur automatically. No upshift to 3rd
or 4th gear occurs. Position 2 may be used to obtain forced downshift to 2nd gear for increased engine
braking effect.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_4_1.html (8 of 11)12/30/2006 9:54:38 AM

1995 Volvo 940

1 (low position)
If position 1 is selected when driving at high speeds, 2 is engaged first and 1 when the speed has
dropped to approx. 30 mph (50 km/h). No upshift can occur once 1 is engaged. Use position 1 to select
low gear when no upshift is desired, for instance, when entering and descending steep grades.

Shift gate positions
The gear selector can be moved freely between D and 3. Selections of other positions are obtained by
depressing the selector knob prior to moving the selector.
Slightly depressing the selector knob allows selection of positions N, D, 3 and L. Fully depressing the
selector knob allows selection of positions R and P. This is also necessary when initially bringing the
selector out of position P. Fully depressing the selector knob thus permits shifting freely between all
positions.

4th gear disengagement:
The 4th gear is engaged automatically after the transmission has shifted through 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears
at certain speeds and loads. By pressing in the button at the rear of the selector level, the 4th gear can be
disengaged, thus providing a three-speed transmission. As a reminder the é light on the dashboard
glows. By pressing in the button again, the transmission reverts to four-speed operation and the é
light shuts off.
Disengage the 4th gear when:
- towing a trailer
- driving in mountainous regions.
Since using the 4th gear improves fuel economy, it should be used as often as possible in conditions
other than those stated above.
WARNING!
Never select P or R while the car is in motion.
● When initially selecting positions D, 3, 2, 1, or R, your foot should press firmly on the brake pedal
to ensure that the car is standing still with the engine idling.
● The gear selector should not be downshifted to 2 or 1 at speeds above 75 mph (125 km/h). *
* Always observe local speed limits.
●

Kick-down

1995 Volvo 940

Automatic shift to a lower gear (kick-down) is achieved by depressing the accelerator pedal fully and
briskly. An up-shift will be achieved when approaching the top speed for a particular gear or by
releasing the accelerator pedal slightly. Kick-down can be used for maximum acceleration or when
passing at highway speeds below a certain limit.
NOTE: The kickdown feature should not be used during the break-in
period.

pg. 4:14 Jump starting

Jump starting
CAUTION:
Improper hook-up of jumper cables or use of other than 12-volt batteries could result in damage to
equipment and/or battery.

Check that cars are not touching to prevent premature completion of negative circuit. Note the position
of the battery terminals and using jumper cables:
First connect booster battery positive (+) terminal (1) to car battery positive (+) terminal (2).
● Then connect booster battery negative (-) terminal (3) to a stationary solid metal part on the engine at
a point away from the battery (4).
●

Do not connect booster cable to any part of fuel system or any moving parts. Avoid touching hot
manifolds.
After engine has started, remove first the negative (-) terminal jumper cable. Then remove the positive
(+) terminal jumper cable.

WARNING!
To reduce the possibility of explosion, never expose battery to open flame or electric spark. Do not
smoke near battery. Batteries generate hydrogen gas which is flammable and explosive. Battery fluid
contains sulfuric acid. Do not allow battery fluid to contact eyes, skin, fabrics or painted surfaces. If
contact occurs, flush affected area immediately with water.
Obtain medical attention immediately if eyes are affected.

WARNING!
Failure to follow the instructions for jump starting can lead to personal
injury.
pg. 4:15 Winter driving

Cold weather precautions
● If you wish to check your car before the approach of cold weather, the following advice is worth
noting:
Make sure that the engine coolant contains at least 50 percent antifreeze: that is, 5.3 qts. (5 liters) Volvo
Genuine Coolant/Antifreeze. This gives protection against freezing down to -31°F (-35°C). See section
"Coolant".
The use of "recycled" antifreeze is not approved by Volvo. Different types of antifreeze may not be
mixed.
● Try to keep the fuel tank well filled - this prevents the formation of condensation in the tank.
In addition in extremely cold weather conditions it is worthwhile to add fuel line de-icer before
refueling.
● The viscosity of the engine oil is important. Oil with low viscosity (thinner oil) improves coldweather starting as well as decreasing fuel consumption while the engine is warming up. For winter use,
5W-30 oil, particularly the synthetic type, is recommended.
Be sure to use good quality oil but do not use this cold-weather oil for hard driving or in warm weather.
See section "Engine oil" for more information.
● The load placed on the battery is greater during the winter since the heater, windshield wipers,
lighting etc. are used more often. Moreover, the capacity of the battery decreases as the temperature
drops. In very cold weather, a poorly charged battery can freeze and be damaged. It is therefore
advisable to check the state of charge more frequently and spray an anti-rust oil on the battery posts.
● Volvo recommends the use of snow tires on all four wheels for winter driving - see section "Wheels
and tires".
● To prevent the washer reservoir from freezing, add washer solvents containing antifreeze. This is
important since the dirt is often splashed on the windshield during winter driving, thus requiring
frequent use of the washers and wipers. The Volvo Washer Solvent should be diluted as follows:
Down to 14°F (-10°C): 1 part anti-freeze and 4 parts water
file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_4_14.html (2 of 6)12/30/2006 9:54:39 AM

1995 Volvo 940

Down to 5°F (-15°C): 1 part anti-freeze and 3 parts water
Down to 0°F (-18°C): 1 part anti-freeze and 2 parts water
Down to -18°F (-28°): 1 part anti-freeze and 1 part water
● Use lock spray or grease in the locks.
NOTE: Avoid the use of de-icing spray as they can cause damage to the
locks.

Automatic differential lock
The differential automatically locks at speed between 3 - 25 mph (5 - 40 km/h) if either of the drive
wheels begins to lose traction. The differential lock improves power distribution to the drive wheels in
slippery conditions, shifting power to the wheel with best traction. It also functions when the
transmission is in reverse.
pg. 4:16 Towing a trailer

When preparing for trailer hauling, observe the following:
● Use a trailer hitch which meets Federal Safety Standards for rear end collisions (FMVSS 301-75) For
trailer weights exceeding 2000 lbs. (908 kg), use only a trailer hitch offered as a Genuine Volvo
Accessory. Since the automatic transmission is subject to increased load and temperature, certain
vehicles are equipped with an extra oil cooler as standard equipment. Consult your Volvo dealer for
additional information.
● Maximum trailer weight recommended by
Volvo is:
Trailers without brakes : 1100 lbs (500kg)
Trailers with brakes: 2" ball - 3300 lbs (1500 kg), 1 7/8" ball - 2000 lbs (908 kg).
Observe legal requirements of the state in which the vehicles are registered.
All Volvo models are equipped with energy-absorbing shock-mounted bumpers. Trailer hitch
installation should not interfere with the proper operation of this bumper system.
WARNING! Never connect a trailer's hydraulic brake system directly to the vehicle brake system, nor
a trailer's lighting system directly to the vehicle lighting system. Consult your nearest authorized
Volvo retailer for correct installation.

1995 Volvo 940

WARNING! Bumper-attached trailer hitches must not be used on Volvos, nor should safety chains be
attached to the bumper. Trailer hitches attaching to the vehicle rear axle must not be used.

Trailer towing does not normally present any particular problems, but take into consideration:
● Recommended hitch tongue load is 110 (50 kgs) for trailer weights below 2,650 lbs (1,200 kgs) and
165 lbs (75 kgs) for trailer weights above 2,650 lbs (1,200 kgs).
● For trailer weights between 2,650-3,300 lbs (1,200-1,500 kgs) a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/h)
should never be exceeded.
● Increase tire pressure to recommended full-load pressure. See section "Wheels and tires".
● Engine and transmission are subject to increased loads. Therefore, engine coolant temperature should
be closely watched when driving in hot climates or hilly terrain. Use lower gear and turn off air
conditioner if temperature gauge pointer enters the red range.
● Avoid overload and other abusive operation.
● Hauling a trailer affects handling, durability, and economy.
● It is necessary to balance trailer brakes with the towing vehicle brakes to provide a safe stop. Check
and observe State/Local regulations.
● More frequent vehicle maintenance is required.
● Remove the ball and drawbar assembly when the hitch is not being used,
● Volvo recommends the use of synthetic engine oil when towing a trailer over long distances or in
mountainous areas.
● The trailer hitch tongue load (110/165 lbs - 50/75 kg) is part of the vehicle's capacity weight. It may
be necessary to reduce the trunk/cargo area load when towing a trailer to ensure that the max.
permissible axle load or gross vehicle weight are not exceeded.
NOTE: Refer to section "Automatic transmission" for additional trailer hauling
tips.
pg. 4:17 Brake system

If one of the brake circuits should malfunction, the red warning light will come on. (see page 1:4)
The pedal stroke increases slightly, the pedal feels softer and extra pressure is required for normal
braking.
If the light comes on while driving or braking, stop immediately and check the brake fluid level in the
reservoir.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_4_14.html (4 of 6)12/30/2006 9:54:39 AM

1995 Volvo 940

WARNING!
If the fluid level is below the MIN mark in either section of the reservoir: DO NOT DRIVE. Tow the
car to a Volvo retailer and have the brake system checked and any leakage repaired.

If the brake power-assist does not function
The power assist to the brakes functions only when the engine is running. When the car is moving
without the engine running the brake pedal pressure required to stop the car is increased by 3-4 times.
The brake pedal feels stiff and hard.
Moisture on brake discs and brake pads affects braking.
Driving in rain and slush or passing through an automatic car wash can cause water to collect on the
brake discs and pads. This will cause a delay in braking effect when the pedal is depressed. To avoid
such a delay when the brakes are needed, depress the pedal occasionally when driving through rain,
slush etc. This will remove the water from the brakes. Check that brake application feels normal. This
should also be done after washing or starting in very damp weather.
Severe strain on the brake system
The brakes will be subject to severe strain when driving in mountains or hilly areas. The speed is usually
low which means that the cooling of the brakes is less efficient than when driving on level roads. To
reduce the strain on the brakes it is advisable not to use the brakes excessively. Instead, shift into a lower
gear and let the engine help with the braking. A good rule is to use the same gear downhill as would be
used ascending the same grade. For vehicles with automatic transmission use position 2 or, in some
cases, 1.
Do not forget that, if you are towing a trailer, the brakes will be subjected to greater load than is normal.
pg. 4:18 Long distance trip

Before a long distance trip
It is always worthwhile to have your car checked at a Volvo dealer before driving long distances. Your
dealer will also be able to supply you with bulbs, fuses, spark plugs and wiper blades for your use in the
event that problems occur.
If you prefer to check the car yourself, please note the following:
● Check that the engine runs smoothly and that fuel consumption is normal.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_4_14.html (5 of 6)12/30/2006 9:54:39 AM

1995 Volvo 940

Check engine oil, coolant levels, and for possible fuel leakage.
● Check transmission oil level and rear axle for leakage.
● Check condition of drive belts.
● Check state of charge of battery.
● Examine tires carefully (the spare tire as well), and replace those that are worn. Check tire pressures.
● The brakes, front wheel alignment, and steering gear should be checked by your Volvo dealer only.
● Check all lights, including high beams.
● Reflective warning triangles are legal requirement in some countries.
● Have a word with your Volvo dealer concerning engine adjustments if you intend to drive in countries
where it may be difficult to obtain correct fuel.
●

pg. 4:19 ABS

Anti-lock Brake System - ABS
If the warning lamp lights up there is a malfunction of the ABS system (the standard braking system will
however function) and the vehicle should be driven to a Volvo dealer for inspection.
The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) helps to improve vehicle control (stopping and steering) during
severe braking conditions by limiting brake lock-up. When the system "senses" impending lock-up,
braking pressure is automatically modulated in order to help prevent lockup, which could lead to a skid.
The system performs a self-diagnostic test when the vehicle is started and at 4 mph (6 km/h). The driver
may detect one pulsation of the brake pedal, which is normal. To obtain optimal effect from the ABS
system, constant pressure should be kept on the brake pedal while the system is modulating the brakes.
Do not pump the brake pedal.
The switching of the ABS modulator will be audible at this time.
Please be aware that ABS does not increase the absolute braking potential of the vehicle.
While control will be enhanced, ABS will not shorten stopping distances on slippery surfaces.

pg. 4:9 Three-way catalytic converter

Three-way catalytic converter cautions

Keep your engine properly tuned. Certain engine malfunctions, particularly involving the electrical,
fuel or distributor ignition systems, may cause unusually high three-way catalytic converter
temperatures. Do not continue to operate your vehicle if you detect engine misfire, noticeable loss of
power or other unusual operating conditions, such as engine overheating or backfiring. A properly tuned
engine will help avoid malfunction that could damage the three-way catalytic converter.
● Remember that tampering or unauthorized modification to the engine or the vehicle may be illegal
and can cause three-way catalytic converter or exhaust system overheating. This includes:
- Altering fuel injection settings or components. Adjusting distributor ignition timing beyond specified
limits.
- Altering emission system components or location or removing components
- Repeated use of leaded fuel.
● Do not park your car over combustible materials, such as grass or leaves, which can come into contact
with the hot exhaust system and cause such materials to ignite under certain wind and weather
conditions.
● Excessive starter cranking (in excess of one minute), with an intermittently firing or flooded engine,
can cause three-way catalytic converter or exhaust system overheating.
●

NOTE: Unleaded fuel is required for cars with three-way catalytic converters. A label on the
instrument panel and inside fuel tank filler door will remind owners and filling station attendants of
this requirement.
Important! It is unlawful to dispense leaded fuel into any vehicle labeled "unleaded gasoline only".

pg. 4:10 Points to remember

Weight distribution affects handling
At the specified curb weight your car has a tendency to understeer, which means that the steering wheel
has to be turned more than might seem appropriate for the curvature of a bend. This ensures good
stability and reduces the risk of rear wheel skid. Remember that these properties can alter with the
vehicle load. The heavier the load in the trunk, the less the tendency to understeer.
Handling, roadholding
Vehicle load, tire design, and inflation pressure, all affect vehicle handling. Therefore, check that the
tires are inflated to the recommended pressure according to the vehicle load. See "Tire pressure" section.
Loads should be distributed so that capacity weight or maximum permissible axle loads are not
exceeded.
WARNING! It is recommended that tire of the same make and dimensions be used on all four wheels
(including the use of snow tires). Do not use bias ply tires as this will adversely alter vehicle handling
characteristics.

WARNING!
An extra mat on the driver's floor can cause the accelerator pedal to catch. Check that the movement of
the accelerator pedal is not impeded. Not more than one protective floor covering may be used at one
time.

CAUTION: Driving through standing water
Drive slowly and carefully if going through standing water (i.e. flooded roadways, etc.). Damage to
engine could result if excess water is ingested through the air intake system.
Never drive the vehicle in water deeper than 1 foot (300 mm). See the flood warning on page 3:7.

WARNING! Do not drive with trunk lid or tailgate open!
Poisonous exhaust gases may enter via the trunk lid or tailgate.
If the trunk lid/tailgate must be kept open for any reason, proceed as follows:
●

Close the windows.

●

Set the ventilation system control to

and blower control to its highest

setting.

Roof racks (removable and permanent)
Roof rails are available as Volvo accessories. Observe the following points when is use:
● Avoid single-point loads. Distribute the load evenly.
● Place heavier cargo at bottom of load.
● Observe that center of gravity and handling are influenced by load weight.
● Increasing load size increases wind resistance and, thus, adversely affects fuel economy.
● Anchor the cargo correctly with a cord.
● Drive carefully. Avoid rapid starts, fast cornering and hard braking.
● Max. roof load is 220 lbs. (100 kg) for removable racks mounted on drip rails. For permanent roof
racks, check the manufacturers weight specifications.
Cooling system
The risk for overheating is greatest, especially in hot weather, when:
● towing a trailer up steep inclines for prolonged periods at wide open throttle and low engine rpm.
● stopping the engine suddenly after high speed driving (so-called "after-boiling" can occur).
pg. 4:11 Points to remember (cont.)

To avoid overheating, the following rules should be followed:
● Reduce speed and downshift when towing a trailer up long, steep inclines. The risk of overheating can
be reduced by switching off the air conditioning system for a short time.
● Do not let the engine idle unnecessarily for prolonged periods.
● Do not mount auxiliary lamps in front of the grill.
When the risk of overheating is imminent, or in the event of overheating, (the temperature gauge goes
repeatedly into, or stays continually in, the red section) the following precautions should be taken:
● Switch off the air conditioning system.
● Stop the car and put the gear lever into neutral. Do not stop the engine!
● Switch the heater to full (maximum) position. Increase the engine speed to approx. 2000 rpm (twice

idling speed) until the temperature begins to drop.
See "Coolant" to check and top-up the coolant level if necessary.
WARNING! Do not remove coolant expansion tank
cap.

Electrical system
When replacing the battery or when carrying out work involving the electrical system, the following
should be observed:
● A battery connection to the wrong terminal will damage the diodes. Before connections are made,
check the polarity of the battery with a voltmeter.
● If booster batteries are used for starting, they must be properly connected to minimize the risk of the
diode being damaged.
For correct connection, see "Jump starting" section.
● Never disconnect the battery circuit (for example, to replace the battery) while the engine is running,
as this will immediately ruin the generator. Always make sure that all the battery connections are
properly tightened.
● If any electrical/welding work is performed on the vehicle, the battery's ground lead (negative cable)
and all the connecting cables of the generator must be disconnected and the welder cables placed as near
the welding point as possible.
● If the radio has an anti-theft code and the battery has been disconnected, the code must be re-entered
before the radio will function properly.

Precautionary steps to observe when car is in tow
● Steering must be unlocked.
● Please check with state and local authorities before attempting this type of towing, as vehicles being
towed are subject to regulations regarding maximum towing speed, length and type of towing device,
lighting, etc.
● Remember that power brake and power steering assists will not be available when engine is
inoperative. Brake pedal pressure required is 3 - 4 times above normal and greater steering effort must
be exerted.
● Gear selector in position N. Check transmission oil level (see section titled "Transmission oil").
● Maximum speed: 20 mph (30 km/h).
● Maximum distance with rear wheels on ground: 20 miles (30 km).
● If the battery is dead, it is not possible to release the gear selector by pressing the brake pedal. Release
the gear selector manually, see page 4:9.
Cars equipped with automatic transmission/three-way catalytic converters cannot be started by pushing
or pulling the car.
CAUTION: The towing eyelets must not be used for pulling another vehicle out of a ditch or any
similar purpose involving severe strain.
pg. 4:13 Vehicle towing information

Only use wheel lift or flat bed equipment.
CAUTION:
Sling-type equipment applied at the front will damage radiator and air conditioning lines.
It is equally important not to use slingtype equipment inside the rear wheels: serious damage to the
rear axle may result.

Wheels and tires
pg. 5:1 Wheels and tires

Wheels and tires
The handling and riding comfort of the vehicle is dependent on the inflation pressure and the type of
tires fitted. Read the following pages carefully.
5:2 General information, Wear indicator, Tire economy, Flat spots
5:3 Snow chains, Winter tires
5:4 Inflation pressure
pg. 5:2 Wheels and tires (cont.)

General information
Your vehicle is equipped with tires according to the tire information label located on the rear facing side
of the right front door.
The following is an example of a tire designation code:
195 = tire width in mm.
60 = tire profile. This is the relationship (in percent) between the section height and the width of the tire.
R = radial tires.
15 = diameter in inches on all four wheels.
The tires have good road holding characteristics and offer good handling on dry and wet surfaces. Your
Volvo may be equipped with "all-season" tires, which provide a somewhat higher degree of winter
roadholding on slippery surfaces than tires without the "all-season" rating. However, for optimum road
holding on icy or snow covered roads - we recommend suitable winter tires.
When replacing tires, be sure that the new tires are the same size designation, type (radial) and
preferably from the same manufacturer, on all four wheels. Otherwise there is a risk of altering the car's
road-holding and handling characteristics.
NOTE: When storing wheel/tire assemblies (e.g. winter tires and wheels), either lay the assemblies on
their sides or suspend them off the ground.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_5_1.html (1 of 5)12/30/2006 9:54:41 AM

1995 Volvo 940

Wear indicator
The tires have a so-called "wear indicator" in the form of a number of narrow strips running across or
parallel to the tread. When approx. 1/16" (1.6 mm) is left on the tread, these strips show up and indicate
that the tire should be replaced.
Tires with less than 1/16" (1.6 mm) tread have a very poor grip in rain or snow.
When replacing worn tires, it is recommended that the tire be identical in type (radial) and size as the
one being replaced. Using a tire of the same make (manufacturer) will prevent alteration of the driving
characteristics of the vehicle.
To improve tire economy:
Maintain correct tire pressure.
● Drive smoothly: avoid fast starts, hard braking and tire screeching.
● Tire wear increases with speed.
● Do not change wheel location unless necessary.
● Correct front wheel alignment is very important. Unbalanced wheels impair tire economy and driving
comfort.
● If the wheels are rotated, they should be kept on the same side of the car so that they revolve in the
same direction as prior to rotation.
● Hitting curbs or potholes can damage the tires and/or wheels permanently.
●

Flat spots
All tires become warm during use. After cooling, when the vehicle is parked, the tires have a tendency to
distort slightly, forming flat spots. These flat spots can cause vibrations similar to the vibrations caused
by imbalanced wheels.
They do, however, disappear when the tire warms up. The degree to which the flat spots form depends
on the type of cord used in the tire. Remember that, in cold weather, it takes longer for the tire to warm
up and consequently longer for the flat spot to disappear.
pg. 5:3 Wheels and tires (cont.)

Snow chains
Snow tire chains can be used on your Volvo with the following restrictions:
● Snow chains should be installed on your rear wheels only.
● Snow chains can be used on the tires and wheels provided as original production equipment with your
Volvo. If accessory, aftermarket or "custom" tires and wheels are installed and are wider than 205 mm,
chains CANNOT be used. Sufficient clearances between chains and brakes, suspension and components

1995 Volvo 940

must be maintained.
● Some strap-on type chains will interfere with brake components and therefore CANNOT be used.
CAUTION:
Check local regulations regarding the use of snow chains before installing.
● Always follow the chains manufacturer's installation instructions carefully. Install chains as tightly
as possible and re-tighten periodically.
● Never exceed the chain manufacture's specified maximum speed limit. (Under no circumstances
should that limit be higher than 30 mph (50 km/h).
● Avoid bumps, holes or sharp turns when driving with snow chains.
● The handling of the vehicle can be adversely affected when driving with chains. Avoid fast or sharp
turns as well as locked wheel braking.
●

Snow tires, studded tires *
Tires for winter use:
Owners who live in or regularly commute through areas with sustained periods of snow or icy driving
conditions are strongly advised to fit suitable winter tires to help retain the highest degree of traction.
It is important to install winter tires on all four wheels to help retain traction during cornering, braking
and accelerating. Failure to do so could reduce traction to an unsafe level or adversely affect handling.
Do not mix tires of different design as this could also negatively affect overall tire road grip.
Winter tires wear more quickly on dry roads in warm weather. They should be removed when the winter
driving season has ended.
Studded tires should be run-in 300-600 miles (500-1000 km) during which the car should be driven as
smoothly as possible to give the studs the opportunity to seat properly in the tires. The car tires should
have the same rotational direction throughout their entire lifetime. In other words, if you wish to rotate
the wheels, make sure that the same wheels are always on the same side of the car.
NOTE: Please consult state or local regulations restricting the use of studded winter tires before
installing such tires.

WARNING! Special wheel rims for air dams
Only special wheel rims, tested and approved by Volvo, are suitable for use with the air dam installed
on the 940.

* Where permitted
pg. 5:4 Wheels and tires

Checking and correcting tire pressure
Check the tire pressure when refueling.
The tire pressure should be corrected only when the tires are cold. With warm tires, correct only when
the pressure is too low. The tire temperature rises after driving just a few miles.
Vehicle Loading
The tires on your Volvo will perform to specifications at all normal loads when inflated as
recommended on the tire information label* located on the rear facing side on the right front door. This
label lists both the tire and vehicle design limits. Do not load your car beyond the load limits indicated.

NOTE:
To avoid excessive wear and the necessity of rebalancing, mark and reinstall wheels in same location
and position as before removal. To lessen the chance of imbalance, each wheel hub is equipped with a
guide stud to ensure that a removed wheel can be reinstalled in its original position (as when changing
over to winter tires/wheels). When reinstalling the wheel cap, allow a gap of approximately 1/5" (5
mm) between the cap and the rim to help prevent imbalance.

NOTE: The crank handle on the jack can be folded out by pressing the nob on the handle downward
(see illustration above). To attach the jack, refer to the illustration on the following page.

Attaching the jack
There is a jack attachment adjacent to each wheel location. Position the jack on the bar in the jack
attachment as shown in the illustration above and crank while simultaneously guiding the base to the
ground. The base of the jack must be flat on a level, firm, non-slippery surface. Before raising the car
check that the jack is still correctly positioned in the attachment . Now raise the vehicle until the wheel
is free of the ground. Unscrew the wheel nuts completely and carefully remove the wheel so as not to
damage the tread of the studs.

WARNING!
The jack attachment must engage the bar in the jack attachment (A). The car's weight must not rest
on the jack's attachment (B).
● Be sure the jack is on a firm, level, non-slippery surface.
● Never allow any part of your body to be extended under a car supported by a jack.
● Use the jack intended for the car when replacing a wheel. For any other job, use stands to support
the end of the car being worked on.
● Apply the parking brake, select position P (automatic transmission).
● Block the wheels standing on the ground. Use rigid wooden blocks or large stones.
● The jack should be kept well-greased.

Installing the wheel
Clean the contact surfaces on the wheel and hub. Lift the wheel and place it on the hub. Make sure that
you align the wheel with the guide stud on the wheel hub prior to installation. Install the wheel nuts
crosswise and tighten lightly. The conical side of the nuts should face the wheel. Lower the vehicle to
the ground and alternately tighten the nuts to 63 lbs. (85 Nm). Install the wheel cap.
Some models have a hub cap that extends to the wheel rim. The valve symbol on the inside of the hub
cap should be installed toward the valve.

Car care
pg. 7:1 Car care

Car care includes not only maintaining the appearance of the car, but also protecting the car exterior
from the effects of air pollution, rain and mud.
The rustproofing compound under the car should be checked regularly and, if necessary, damaged areas
should be repaired.
The paintwork should also be touched up immediately, if damaged, to prevent rust formation.
7:2 Rustproofing
7:4 Paintwork damage
7:6 Washing the car
7:8 Cleaning the upholstery
pg. 7:2 Rustproofing

What causes rust
The two most common causes of rust to your car are:
The accumulation of road dirt and moisture in hard-to-get-at cavities and other areas under the car.
● The removal of paint and protective coatings on the outside of the car and underneath through damage
by stones, gravel or minor accidents.
●

Several factors influence the speed at which corrosion will occur:
The length of time various parts of a car stay wet. Parts of the car filled with road dirt and water
remain damp for long periods of time even after other parts have dried.
Particular attention should be paid to the underside of the car and floor sections inside. The floor
sections stay wet because moisture collects and remains under the floor matting.
Drain holes located at the bottom of the doors can get clogged with dirt, trapping water inside the door
and causing the door to rust at the bottom.
● Corrosion will be accelerated in areas of higher relative humidity, especially where temperatures often
●

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_7_1.html (1 of 10)12/30/2006 9:54:45 AM

1995 Volvo 940

stay above the freezing point and where the atmosphere is affected by industrial pollution, or where salt
is used for de-icing the roads.
Where parts of the car are covered with road dirt containing road salt, corrosion will be accelerated at
lower relative humidity than if the surface were clean.
● Increased temperature will cause an accelerated rate of corrosion of those parts of the car which are
not well ventilated to permit quick drying.
● Industrial pollution and the presence of salt will also accelerate the deterioration of paint finishes.
The foregoing identifies the need for every car owner to keep his or her car-particularly the underside-as
clean and dry as possible and to repair any minor damage to paintwork and protective coating as soon as
possible.
The need is more important in those areas where road salt is used for de-icing, the relative humidity is
higher, air pollution is present, and temperatures regularly stay above freezing.
Rustproofing, inspection and touching-up
Your Volvo was carefully and thoroughly rustproofed at the factory.
The underbody and wheelhousings were sprayed with a thick, durable rustproofing compound and the
beams, internal cavities and end sections were sprayed with a low viscous, penetrating rustproofing
agent.
There are two very effective methods of maintaining this protection:
● Keep your car clean.
Clean the underbody, wheelhousings and the edges of the fenders using water at high pressure.
● Inspect and touch-up the rustproofing if necessary.
The invisible (internal) rustproofing
As part of your maintenance schedule, it is important that the invisible rustproofing (used for beams,
internal cavities and end sections) be retreated first after 36 months and, thereafter, every 24 months.
Bear in mind, if good results are to be obtained, that these sections must be treated with a fine spray of
Volvo-approved rustproofing compound by your authorized Volvo dealer.
Most of the sheet metal body sections on your Volvo are galvanized, which provides much more
protection against corrosion. There are many imitations of Genuine Volvo sheet metal body sections on
the market. If any body sections on your car need to be replaced because of an accident or other damage,
request only Genuine Volvo sheet metal body sections at the time of the estimate and before your car is
repaired.
pg. 7:3 Rustproofing

The visible rustproofing

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_7_1.html (2 of 10)12/30/2006 9:54:45 AM

1995 Volvo 940

The visible (external) rustproofing must be inspected by an authorized Volvo dealer at 20,000 mile
(32,000 km) intervals. If it is necessary to touch-up the rustproofing, this should be done immediately to
prevent moisture penetration. Wash and dry thoroughly before touching up. Use spray-on or brush-on
rustproofing compounds.
There are two different types of rustproofing compounds available:
a. thin (transparent) for visible parts.
b. thick, for parts on the underbody and wheel housing which experience most wear.
Parts of the car which may need to be touched up and the recommended rustproofing compound are:
● visible welded seams and panel seams-(thin)
● underbody and wheel housings-(thick)
● door hinges-(thin)
● hood hinges and locks-(thin).
After completion of all work on the vehicle, remove excess rustproofing compound with a cloth soaked
in kerosene.
The sheet metal surfaces of the engine compartment are protected by a transparent wax-based
rustproofing compound. The compound withstands normal washings without deterioration.
Mineral based solvents will, however, dissolve the compound, especially so if they contain emulsifiers.
In such cases the wax protection should be renewed.

pg. 7:4 Paint touch-up

Paint touch-up

1995 Volvo 940

Paint damage requires immediate attention to avoid rusting. Make it a habit to check the finish regularly;
when washing the car for instance. Touch up if necessary. Paint repairs require special equipment and
skill. Contact your Volvo retailer for any extensive damages.
Minor scratches can be repaired by using Volvo touch-up paint.
NOTE: When ordering touch-up paint from your Volvo retailer, use the paint code indicated on the
model plate. The plate is located on the panel above the right-side head lights.

NOTE: When touching up the car, it should be cleaned and dry. The surface temperature should be
above 60°F (+15°C).

Paint code
Minor stone chips and scratches
Material:
● Primer - can
● Paint - touch-up bottle
● Masking tape
● Brush
If the stone chip has not penetrated down to the metal and undamaged layer of paint remains, the touchup paint can be applied as soon as the spot has been cleaned.
If the stone chip has been penetrated down to the metal, proceed as follows:
1 Place a strip of masking tape over the damaged surface. Pull the tape off so that any loose flakes of
paint adhere to it.

3 If there is a longer scratch, you may want to protect surrounding paint by masking it off.
Touching up damaged paint on fender edges and sills
Material:
● Primer - spray
● Paint - spray
● Masking tape
NOTE:
When touching up the car, it should be well cleaned and dry and have a temperature exceeding 60°F
(+15°C).

Mask with tape and paper prior to painting larger surfaces. Remove the masking immediately after
application of the last paint coat, before the paint starts to dry.
Touching up is as follows:
● Remove paint flakes with masking tape.
● Shake the spray can for at least 1 minute. Spray on the primer. Move the can slowly and evenly back
and forth over the spot and about 8-12 in. ( 20 - 30 cm) from the surface. Protect the surrounding
surfaces with suitable paper.

1995 Volvo 940

WARNING!
Spray painting should be done in a well ventilated and dust-free
area.

When the primer has dried, apply the surface enamel in the same way. Spray on several times and
allow the paint to dry a minute or so between each application.

●

NOTE: Legislation in your area may prohibit the purchase or use of spray paint. Please check your
local regulations.
pg. 7:6 Washing

Washing the car
The car should be washed at regular intervals since dirt, dust, insects and tar spots adhere to the paint
and may cause damage.
When washing the car, do not expose it to direct sunlight. Use lukewarm water to soften the dirt before
you wash with a sponge, and plenty of water, to avoid scratching.
A detergent can be used to facilitate the softening of dirt and oil. A water-soluble grease solvent may be
used in cases of sticky dirt. However, use a washplace equipped with a drainage separator. Dry the car
with a clean chamois and remember to clean the drain holes in the doors and rocker panels.
The power radio antenna must be dried after washing.
Tar spots can be removed with kerosene or tar remover after the car bas been washed.
A stiff-bristle brush and lukewarm soapy water can be used to clean the wiper blades. Frequent cleaning
improves visibility considerably.

1995 Volvo 940

NOTE:
During high pressure washing the spray mouth piece must never be closer to the vehicle than
13" (30 cm). Do not spray into the locks.
● It is particularly important to wash the car frequently in the wintertime to prevent corrosion, when
salt has been used on the roads.
● Bumpers : Wash the bumpers with the same cleaning agent used on the rest of the car. Never clean
the bumpers with gasoline or paint thinner. Difficult spots can be removed with denatured alcohol. To
avoid scratches, do not dry the bumpers with paper.
●

Also wash off the dirt from the underside (wheel housings fenders, etc..) In areas of high industrial
fallout more frequent washing is also recommended.
Suitable detergents
Special car washing detergents or liquid dishwashing detergent can be used. A suitable mixture is about
2.5 fl. oz. (8.5 cl.) of detergent to 2.6 US gal. (10 liters) of warm water. After washing with a detergent
the car should be well rinsed with clean water.
Bird droppings
Remove from paintwork as soon as possible. Otherwise the finish may be permanently damaged.
WARNING!
When the car is driven immediately after being washed, apply the brake several times in order to
remove any moisture from the brake linings.
Engine cleaning agents should not be used when the engine is warm. This constitutes a fire risk.

NOTE: When washing the car, remember to remove dirt from the drain holes in the doors and
sills.

pg. 7:7 Automatic car washing, Polishing and waxing, Chromed parts

Automatic washing - simple and quick
An automatic wash is a simple and quick way to clean your car. Keeping the underbody clean is most
important, especially in the winter. Some automatic washers do not have the facilities for washing the
underbody. Before driving into an automatic wash, make sure that the side view mirrors, auxiliary
lamps, etc., are secure, otherwise there is risk of the machine dislodging them. You should also lower
the antenna. We recommended that you do not wash your car in an automatic wash during the first six
months (because the paint will not have hardened sufficiently).
Polishing and waxing
Normally, polishing is not required during the first year after delivery, however, waxing may be
beneficial.
Before applying polish or wax the car must be washed and dried. Tar spots can be removed with
kerosene or tar remover. Difficult spots may require a fine rubbing compound.
After polishing use liquid or paste wax.
Several commercially-available products contain both polish and wax. Waxing alone does not substitute
for polishing of a dull surface.
A wide range of polymer-based car waxes can be purchased today.
The waxes are easy to use and produce a long-lasting, high-gloss finish that protects the bodywork
against oxidation, road dirt and fading.
Chromed parts
Chromium-plated and anodized parts should be washed with clean water as soon as they become dirty.
This is particularly important if you drive on gravel roads or on roads where salt is used during the
winter. After the car has been washed, apply wax or an anti-rust preparation.
Stains on chrome trim can be removed with commercially-available chrome cleaner. Do not use abrasive
compounds or steel wool.
pg. 7:8 Cleaning the upholstery

Cleaning the upholstery
The fabric can be cleaned with soapy water or a detergent. For more difficult spots caused by oil, ice
cream, shoe polish, grease, etc.., use a clothing/clothing fabric stain remover.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_7_1.html (9 of 10)12/30/2006 9:54:45 AM

1995 Volvo 940

The plastic in the upholstery can be washed with soapy water or a mild detergent.
Leather upholstery can be cleaned with a soft cloth and mild soap solution.
For more difficult spots, consult your Volvo dealer.
On no account must gasoline, naphtha or similar cleaning agents be used on the plastic or the leather
since these can cause damage.
Cleaning the seat belts
Clean only with lukewarm water and mild soap solution.
Cleaning floor mats
The floor mats should be vacuumed or brushed clean regularly, especially during the winter when they
should be taken out for drying. Spots on textile mats can be removed with a mild detergent.
Bear in mind
● Take extra care when removing stains such as ink or lipstick since the coloring can spread.
● Use solvents sparingly. Too much solvent can damage the seat padding.
● Start from the outside of the stain and work toward the center.

Checking the oil level
The oil level should be checked every time the car is refuelled. Be sure the oil level is maintained
between the upper and lower marks on the dip-stick. Low oil level can cause internal damage to the
engine and over-filling can result in high oil consumption. The distance between the dipstick marks
represents approx. 1 US qt (1 liter) of oil.

1995 Volvo 940

Draining the oil
Drain the oil after driving while it is still hot.
Warning!
The oil may be very
hot.

To add or change engine oil
Add oil of the same kind as already used. Capacity: 4.0 us qts = 3.85 liters incl. filter*
After an oil change, the oil level will lie between the two marks on the dipstick i.e. between MAX and
MIN. This is normal. Do not add too much oil or excessive oil consumption will result.
* if oil cooler (Turbo models) is drained, add 0.7 US qts (0.6 liters).

Warning!
Oil spilled on a hot exhaust pipe constitutes a fire
risk.

Changing oil filter
Replace the oil filter at every oil change.
If you change the engine oil and filter yourself, your Volvo dealer can assist you in disposing of the used
oil. Engine oil can be harmful to your skin - gloves should be worn when performing this work.
pg. 8:6 Engine oil (cont.)

Oil quality
Meeting API specification SG, SG/CD, SH or ILSAC GF-1
For best fuel economy and engine protection consult with your authorized Volvo retailer for
recommended oils. Oils with a different quality rating may not provide adequate engine protection.
Viscosity (stable ambient temperatures):

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_8_1.html (6 of 8)12/30/2006 9:54:47 AM

1995 Volvo 940

Do not use oils with other viscosity ratings. The use of incorrect viscosity oil can shorten engine life.
Volvo recommends the use of energy-conserving oils. Look for the API label. Synthetic oils complying
with oil quality requirements are recommended for: driving in areas of sustained temperature extremes
(hot or cold), when towing a trailer over long distances or for a prolonged driving in mountainous areas.
Extra oil additives must not be used unless advised by an authorized Volvo dealer.
SAE 15W/40 is recommended for use in driving conditions that raise oil temperature and increase oil
consumption (i.e., mountain driving; trailer towing).
NOTE: SAE 15W/40 must not be used at low ambient temperatures; see viscosity chart.
Changing oil and oil filter
Oil and oil filter changes should be made as specified in the following table:
If driving conditions include:
Extended periods of idling and/or low-speed
operation
● Frequent short trips (less than 7 miles = 11 km)
● Extended periods of driving in dusty and/or
sandy areas
● Trailer towing
● Driving in mountainous areas

Automatic transmission oil
Capacity: See "Specifications" section
Fluid type: Automatic Transmission Fluid type Dexron IID or IIE.
Replace: Every 20,000 miles (32,000 km).
Warning!
Oil spilled on a hot exhaust pipe constitutes a fire
risk.

A Cold transmission: oil temperature + 105°F (+40°C).
This is a normal temperature for the transmission after idling for about 10 minutes.
At oil temperature below + 105°F (+40°C), the level may be below the MIN mark.
B Warm transmission: oil temperature + 190°F (+90°C).
This temperature is reached after driving for about 30 minutes.
At oil temperature ABOVE +190°f (+90°c), THE LEVEL MAY BE ABOVE THE max MARK.
NOTE:
The engine should be idling when checking transmission fluid
level.

Check the oil level as follows:
Park the car on level surface with the engine idling.

Slowly move the selector lever through all gear positions and then to position P. Wait 2 minutes before
checking the oil level. As the illustration shows, the dipstick has a "Cold" and a "Warm" side. The oil level
should be between the MIN and MAX marks.
Wipe the dipstick with a clean cloth.
Warning! The oil may be very
hot

Do not use rags that could leave lint on the dipstick.
The transmission is topped up via the dipstick tube.
The space between the MIN and MAX marks on the dipstick corresponds to 0.5 US qt (0.5 liter). Do not fill
the transmission with too much oil, since this can result in oil being ejected from the transmission.
Too little oil, on the other hand, can negatively affect transmission operation, particularly in very cold
weather.
pg. 8:14 Cooling system

If you change the coolant yourself, your Volvo dealer can also assist you in disposing of the used coolant.
Check coolant level
The cooling system must be filled with coolant and not leak to operate at maximum efficiency. Check the
coolant level regularly. The level should be between the "Max" and "Min" marks on the expansion tank. The
check should be made with particular thoroughness when the engine is new or when the cooling system has
been drained.
Do not remove the filler cap other than for topping-up with coolant. Frequent removal may prevent coolant
circulations between the engine tank during engine warm-up and cooling.

1995 Volvo 940

Changing coolant
Normally, the coolant does not need to be changed. If the system must be drained, use the following
procedure:
Remove the expansion tank cap. Open the drain cock on the right side of the engine block and disconnect the
lower radiator hose.
Fill coolant through the expansion tank. The heater controls should be fully open when draining and filling.
Add coolant until the level is up to the MAX mark or slightly above.
Start the engine and run until hot. Check the cooling system connections for tightness. Also re-check the
coolant level.
Capacity: See "Specifications"
coolant: Volvo Genuine Coolant/Antifreeze only
CAUTION!
The cooling system must always be kept filled to correct level.
If it is not kept filled, there can be high local temperatures in the engine which could result in
damage.
Different types of anti-freeze/coolant may not be mixed.

WARNING: If the engine is warm and you are going to top up coolant, unscrew the cap slowly in order to
allow any excess pressure to escape.

NOTE: Do not top up with water only. Water by itself reduces the rust-protective and anti-freeze qualities of
the coolant and has a lower boiling point. It can also cause damage to the cooling system if it should freeze.

Checking the belt tension
The belt tension can be checked by depressing the fan belt (engine not running!) at a point midway between
the generator and fan. It should be possible to press down the belt about 1/4" - 3/8" (5-10 mm). This also
applies to other drive belts on the engine.
WARNING! The engine must not be running when this check is
performed.

Belt check
Check the belt regularly to make sure it is in good condition and is clean. Worn or dirty belts can cause poor
cooling and low generator output as well as impair the operation of the power steering and the air conditioning
unit.
Belt adjustment and replacement
The belts can be difficult to reach and it is advisable to let your Volvo dealer adjust the tension of the belts or
replace them, if necessary.

pg. 8:7 Servicing

Valves
The valve clearance should be check and, if necessary, adjusted every 30,000 miles (48,000 km).
Air cleaner
Replace the air cleaner cartridge with a new one every 30,000 miles (48,000 km). The cartridge should
be replaced more often when driving under dirty and dusty conditions, The filter cannot be cleaned and,
therefore, should always be replaced with a new one.
Vacuum fittings, hoses and connections
Unstable idle, misfiring, or poor emission control is often caused by leaking vacuum hoses or
connections. Check hoses and connections on distributor vacuum unit, connections on heater control
servo systems and hydraulic brake servo.
Checking and adjusting idle air control system
Your Volvo is equipped with an electronically-controlled idle air control system that requires no
checking or adjustment.
Fuel system cap, tank and lines, and connections
The effectiveness of the fuel system to contain hydrocarbons is dependent largely on a leakfree system.
Check for proper sealing of gasoline filler cap which contains "0" ring-type seals. Check all evaporative
hoses in vehicle for tightness. Check fuel lines under vehicle and repair if necessary.
Fuel (line) filter
The fuel line filter is located next to the fuel pump. This filter should be replaced every 100,000 miles
(160,000 km). The filter is replaced as one complete unit.
Replace more frequently if contaminated fuel is introduced into the tank (or if there is reason to suspect
that this has occurred).

for variations in engine load, speed and temperature to give the best economy and power. A mass air
flow sensor or a pressure meter on certain models, measures the inducted air. In this way the system can
make instantaneous adjustments for changes in air temperature or density, thus always assuring the best
economy with the lowest possible exhaust emissions.
Heated oxygen sensor
This is an emission control system designed to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. The heated
oxygen sensor monitors the composition of the exhaust gases leaving the engine. The exhaust gas
analysis is fed into an electronic control module. This adjusts the air-fuel ratio to provide optimum
conditions for combustion and efficient reduction of the three major pollutants (hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide and nitrous gases) by a three-way catalytic converter.
Pulsed Secondary Air Injection
(certain models)
This system adds air to the hot exhaust gases as they are expelled from the engine. This causes a
secondary combustion of residual hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, resulting in lower emissions
levels in the exhaust gases.
pg. 8:9 Servicing (cont.)

Three-way Catalytic Converter
This is a supplementary device in the exhaust system, designed to clean exhaust gases. This device is
mainly a container with a ceramic material insert, designed to let the exhaust gases pass through
channels in the insert. The channel walls are covered by a thin layer of platinum-palladium. These
metals act as catalysts, permitting a chemical action to occur without actually taking part in it. The
emission (CO, HC, NOx) content will increase if the three-way catalytic converter is damaged. Vehicles
file:///K|/ownersdocs/1995/1995_940/95940_8_7.html (3 of 8)12/30/2006 9:54:49 AM

equipped with heated oxygen sensors use three-way catalytic converters containing platinum and
rhodium.
CAUTION:
Vehicles with a three-way catalytic converter must use unleaded fuel only. Otherwise the three-way
catalytic converter will become ineffective. See "Fuel requirements".

Charge air cooler (Intercooler)
The B230F-Turbo engine employs a turbocompressor to force air into the engine inlet manifold and a
charge air cooler to cool the compressed inlet air. The resulting increase in air flow raises pressure in the
intake manifold by approx. 8 psi (over atmospheric pressure) and engine power output by approx. 46
horsepower over that developed by the normally-aspirated engine.
The charge air cooler (which resembles a radiator) is located between the turbocompressor and inlet
manifold.

Evaporative control system
The 940 is equipped with a gas-evaporative control system, which prevents gasoline fumes from being
released into the atmosphere. The system is comprised of an expansion chamber in the fuel tank, and a
charcoal canister with built-in vacuum valve under the left-front wheel housing. The components are
interconnected by hoses which channel fuel vapor from the gas tank to the charcoal filter, where it is
stored until the engine is started and then drawn into the engine's fuel-induction system.

Crankcase ventilation
The engine is equipped with positive crankcase ventilation which prevents crankcase gases from being
released into the atmosphere. Instead, the crankcase gases are admitted to the intake manifold and
cylinders.
PCV system
The PCV nipple in the intake manifold should be removed and inspected every 60,000 miles (96,000
km).

1995 Volvo 940

Check/replace hoses at the same time.
Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)
This system operates by returning some of the exhaust gases to the engine to be recombusted: since this
lowers the combustion temperature the amount of nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere is
reduced.
The EGR valve should be cleaned at 100,000 miles (160,000 km) and thereafter cleaned every 20,000
miles (32,000 km).
pg. 8:11 Servicing
WARNING!
The distributor ignition system operates at very high voltages. Special safety precautions must be
followed to prevent injury.
Always turn the ignition off when:
connecting engine test and diagnostic equipment to the vehicle (timing light, tach-dwell tester,
ignition oscilloscope, etc..).
● Replacing distributor ignition components e.g. plugs, coil, distributor, HT leads etc.
● Do not touch any part of the distributor ignition system while the engine is running. This may result
in unintended movements and body injury.
●

Replacing spark plugs
The spark plugs should be changed every 30,000 miles (48,000 km). However, city driving or fast
highway driving may necessitate changing after 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of driving. When installing
new plugs, be sure to fit the right type and use correct torque, see Specifications. When changing the
plugs, check that the suppressor connectors are in good condition. Cracked or damaged connectors
should be replaced. When changing the spark plugs, clean the terminals and the rubber seals.
CAUTION: Do not use silicone-based lubricants, which can have adverse effects on electrical
components.

Battery:
●

Make sure the battery leads are properly connected and tightened.

1995 Volvo 940

Never disconnect the battery when the engine is running.
● The battery leads must be disconnected when recharging the battery.
● Turn radio off before disconnecting the battery. If the radio has an anti-theft code and the battery has
been disconnected, the code must be re-entered before the radio will function properly.
●

Batteries contain corrosive and toxic acids. It is of the utmost importance that old batteries are disposed
of correctly. Your Volvo dealer can assist you in this matter.
