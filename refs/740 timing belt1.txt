Introduction
The timing belt should be replaced every 50,000 miles.
The B230 engine is a non-interference engine, meaning if the timing belt breaks, the valves will not
impact the pistons, causing great damage, headaches, and great loss of money and time. Still, if the
timing belt breaks, it will leave you stranded.
Test: Remove the oil filler cap. While an assistant hits ignition “Start,” see if the overhead camshaft
rotates. If the camshaft does not rotate, then most likely it is a broken timing belt.

Volvo 5284 crankshaft
pulley holder tool

On the B230 series (240 late models/740/940 Volvo) engines, the
crankshaft pulley is held in place by a highly torqued crankshaft bolt
(unlike the lightly torqued 6 fasteners on the non-B230 engines of
the 240 Volvo). This crankshaft bolt is difficult to loosen and remove
unless you have the special crankshaft pulley holder tool shown at
left. (Some die-hards prefer to remove the starter motor and have an
assistant jam a heavy screwdriver into the flywheel teeth to stop the
crankshaft pulley from moving while loosening the crankshaft pulley
bolt. But this requires another person to help, adds extra work, and
may damage the flywheel teeth.) Having the Volvo 5284 tool makes
changing the timing belt a lot easier and is easily worth the $48 cost
(www.ipdusa.com). Moreover, while it isn’t exactly necessary to
remove the crankshaft pulley bolt with a torque wrench (you will
need a long-handled wrench, cheater bar, and muscle power), you
do need a torque wrench to properly set the tension on the crankshaft pulley bolt on installation and to set proper torque on the overhead camshaft and intermediate shaft pulley bolts if you decide to
replace the oil seals.

Other replacements: Replace all the accessory drive belts. Usually, the tensioner roller should be
replaced (Appendix A) every other time the timing belt is changed. Check that it spins freely with
no noise. Also, check to see that there are no oil leaks around any pulleys. If there are no leaks, you
may skip oil seal replacement. But the standard recommendation is to change the oil seals
(Appendix B) every other time the timing belt is changed. Some people replace everything as a
matter of course, every time. It’s up to you.
Caveats: I’ve read of other people who have used (a) an impact wrench or (b) a long-handled
wrench set hard against an obstruction, then hitting ignition “Start” to turn the crankshaft to loosen the bolt. Realize that the crankshaft pulley boss (the gear) is not as hardy as the old one on nonB230 engines, and its locking knob (for the crankshaft pulley/vibration dampener) may break off.
Also, one DIY’er used an impact wrench to tighten the camshaft bolt and broke it off.

Disassembly
These instructions were derived from a 1987 740 Turbo, B230 FT. Your vehicle may differ somewhat. For
instance, some of the bolt sizes differ on the 940.
To begin with, drive the car up on ramps, chock the rear wheels, set emergency handbrake. Put car in neutral for manual transmission vehicles, Park for automatic transmission. Remove the underbelly pan. (Why?
Because it’s easier to work underneath the car when pulling the crankshaft pulley.)

Disconnect battery ground because you’ll be working around some electrical
components such as the alternator and air conditioning compressor.
Note accessory belt positions:
(a) middle groove of crankshaft pulley connects to
front groove of alternator pulley
(b) front groove of crankshaft pulley to front
groove of air conditioning compressor pulley
(c) back groove of crankshaft pulley to back groove
of waterpump pulley and only groove of power
steering pulley

Figure 1. Take off the fan/clutch
assembly by removing the 4 10-mm nuts.
Pull assembly out.

Figure 2. Remove the two 8-mm fasteners
atop the fan shroud. Pull fan shroud out.
Now you have more working room. (Some
engines are different and may have more
working room as a matter of design.)

Figure 7. Remove the 17 mm nut and washer
from the tensioner. Slip top of crankshaft pulley

and finger tighten. Next, make sure the prongs on
the bottom of holder catches the holes in the
crankshaft gear/vibration dampener (hereafter
called just crankshaft gear or pulley), turning the
crankshaft with the 24 mm socket, if needed.
Once the prongs catch, tighten the 17 mm nut on
the tensioner.

(counterclockwise) the crankshaft bolt. Remove
the bolt.
[Also, if you plan to replace the overhead camshaft
seal, now is the time to break free the 17 mm bolt
holding the overhead cam gear in place.]
Next, in order to pull the crankshaft pulley off, you
will most likely need to loosen and remove the
alternator and AC compressor belts.

Figure 9. To slip the alternator and AC belts off,
first loosen the 13 mm hold-down nuts [arrows

10 mm tensioning bolts [arrows in (b)] for both.
You may also have to loosen the 13 mm pivoting
bolt and nut [arrows in (c)] of the alternator and
AC. Slip belts off pulleys. (I had to remove the
whole tightening assembly for the alternator,
allowing the alternator to lean against the AC
compressor. Only then could I get the alternator
belt off.)

Figure 10. Without the belt tension, the crankshaft pulley should be easy to remove. Grab the
pulley on opposite sides with both hands and
rock it back and forth while pulling. If it is difficult
to get off, gently pry in back with a flat-bladed
screwdriver.

If you choose to not replace the tensioner or the front oil seals, then go to Figure 15. Otherwise,
to replace the tensioner, see Appendix A. To replace the oil seals, go to Appendix B.
Figure 15. On the B230 engine, the
crankshaft pulley is composed of an inner and
outer pulley with rubber sandwiched between
them to help dampen engine vibration. Over time,
the rubber deteriorates and the inner and outer
pulleys tend to rotate independently. When you
put a timing light on the crankshaft pulley, the
marks will seem to “run,” rather than stay in one
place. [If the pulleys are completely independent,
the rotational energy of the crankshaft (inner
pulley) will not be transmitted to the outer pulley,
and thus the accessory pulleys: waterpump, alternator, power steering, and air conditioning. Failure
of the waterpump pulley will seize your engine up;
failure of the alternator will mean your fuel injection will not work.]

Replacement part:
Scantech. ~$80 from IPD.

Once off the crankshaft, check to see that the
inner and outer pulleys still turn together as one
unit and that there is no play when you rock the
two pulleys side to side. If fine, re-use. Otherwise,
replace.

See http://auto.howstuffworks.com/engine1.htm
for a nice graphic of how the gasoline internal
combustion engine works.

Also, while on engine, make sure that the tensioner roller spins freely with no noise. If it’s stiff or
noisy, replace (Appendix A).
Figure 16. Most likely, if you had rotated
the crankshaft per Figure 6, your alignment marks
should align per A, B, and C of this figure. That is,
A = dot on overhead camshaft pulley aligns to
nub on rear plate, B = dot on intermediate shaft
gear to nub on rear plate, and C = notch on front
crankshaft shim to ridge on front of engine. (Also
refer to Figure 18.)

If you have trouble aligning the marks per A, B,
and C, then your timing belt has slipped. Not to
worry; just make sure that these marks are
aligned when you put on the new belt.
Clean area around C with solvent-soaked rag.

Reassembly
Your new timing belt should have three marks: two single line marks align to the overhead camshaft and
intermediate shaft respectively while the double line mark aligns to the crankshaft. The closest single line
mark to the double line mark is that for the intermediate shaft, as shown in Figure 17.

double line
mark to
crankshaft

There is more than one method to install the timing belt. I prefer the following technique.

single line
mark to
intermediate
shaft

1. First, pin the tensioner spring, per Figure
13b.
2. Next, slip new belt over the crankshaft pulley
boss, with the double lines of belt on left side of
crankshaft pulley boss. Forget about the double
lines for now, and instead, align the crankshaft
per Figure 18C, notch of front crankshaft shim to
nub on front of engine. (Disregard fact that
crankshaft pulley has been installed in this photo;
I forgot to take a photo with pulley off.)

3. Pull the belt up and around the intermediate shaft pulley
and align the single line mark to the dot on the wheel and
background nub at 3:00 per Figure 18B. This single line mark
is about 26 cm from the double line mark (Figure 17). [It
helps to mark the front edge of the belt adjacent to the line,
as shown in Figures 18A and B.]

(C)

A useful marking tool is a Liquid
Paper All Purpose Correction Pen,
especially for marking the background ridge for Figure 18C.

Once you align the single line mark to the intermediate shaft,
then pull and stretch underside of belt tightly over the crankshaft pulley boss and over the tensioner roller. Then, pull the
upper side of belt onto overhead camshaft gear such that the
other single line mark lines up to the dot on the overhead
camshaft gear and to the background nub on the rear plate,
per Figure 18A. You may have to rotate the intermediate
shaft either counterclockwise or clockwise, as needed, to
align the teeth so as to ease the belt onto the overhead camshaft sprocket. Adjustment may also be needed at the crankshaft pulley boss.

4. Pull the pin to release the tensioner spring and
install washer and 17 mm nut on the tensioner.
Tighten. (Figure 19.)
5. Temporarily install the crankshaft pulley per
Figure 20, making sure the notch on back of
crankshaft pulley locks onto the knob (arrow) of
the crankshaft pulley boss. Insert bolt and tighten
a bit. (You’re installing the crankshaft pulley here
because you may need to use the pulley holder to
remove the bolt after doing rotation of step 6.)
At this point, you can doublecheck that
the double lines on the timing belt align
to the u-notch on the front shim of the
crankshaft pulley by turning the crankshaft
gear counterclockwise ~60 degrees or so (if
I remember right). It should align per Figure
21 if alignments of Figure 18A and C were
correctly made.

Figure 19.

Figure 21. (The pulley is
off for photo purposes.)

Figure 20.

6. If you checked alignment per Figure 21, use the 24 mm socket wrench turn the crankshaft back to position of Figure 18C. Now turn the crankshaft pulley 2X (i.e., 720°) clockwise and observe if the belt stays
on the tensioner roller and all gears. (See sidebar next page.) If it does, doublecheck and triplecheck that
all the alignment marks of pulleys to background marks of Figure 16 (or Figures 18A, B, and C) still hold.
Failure of alignment here means re-doing this whole process again later. (We do not care about the
alignment marks on the belt. They were only useful for the initial alignment and are nearly impossible to
align again to the pulleys.) If pulley marks align to background, then pull the crankshaft pulley off (you
may have to use the crankshaft pulley holder to loosen bolt).
7. Install the lower timing belt cover. Refer to Figure 12 for correct bolts. Also, the bolts go through the
holes for the back cover plate (Figure B19, Appendix B).
8. Put the crankshaft pulley back on, making sure the notch locks onto knob per Figure 20, and insert the
pulley bolt. Set up the crankshaft pulley holder and torque the crankshaft pulley bolt to 44 ft-lbs.
page 10

9. After setting initial torque of 44 ft-lbs, make a
vertical mark on the crankshaft bolt at 12:00
(Figure 22). The Bentley manual says that the
correct torque means another 60 degrees of
turning clockwise. I then used a torque wrench
set at 150 ft-lbs and was only able to turn the
bolt through ~40 degrees. Next, I used a longhandled wrench with cheater bar (Figure 23), but
was only successful in turning the bolt an additional 8 degrees for a total of about 48 degrees
(Figure 24). Good enough for me!

Figure 22.
10. Remove the pulley holder and replace with
washer and 17 mm nut on tensioner roller. Tighten. Hook up battery ground cable. With everything out of the way, have someone start the
engine and run it for 30 seconds to check that
everything works. After engine stops, check for
oil leaks.

Tightening torques:
• crankshaft bolt: 44 ft-lbs + 60°
• tensioner nut: 37 ft-lbs
Tensioner roller: Beware of no-name
tensioners, most likely made in China. My new
no-name tensioner’s hanging plate pulled away
from the roller bearing. Buy OEM or aftermarket European makes, such as INA.

Figure 23.

Problem: Using the new INA tensioner roller, I
could not get the belt to stay on the overhead
camshaft gear and roller when I rotated the
crankshaft 720°. The old roller’s hanger plate
had a slight bend to it while the new one did
not. A professional mechanic said the hanger
plate is supposed to be flat and that something is out of alignment. I couldn’t figure out
the alignment problem (it being late fall) and
resorted to reusing the old tensioner.

Figure 24.

11. If everything checks out, disconnect battery ground. (You’ll be working around the alternator.)
12. Slip new accessory belts onto grooves of crankshaft pulley and corresponding slave pulleys:
But first, insert the alternator and AC belts through the waterpump/power steering belt and hang the
latter over the alternator and AC belts per Figure 25.
(a) middle groove of crankshaft pulley connects to front groove of alternator pulley
(b) front groove of crankshaft pulley to front groove of air conditioning compressor pulley
(c) back groove of crankshaft pulley to back groove of waterpump pulley and only groove of power steering pulley

Figure 25.
13. Tension the alternator belt and AC belt using the nuts and bolts mentioned in Figure 9. Belts should
depress about 5 mm in the middle when pushed with the thumb.
14. Install upper timing belt cover. Refer to Figure 3.

15. Place fan shroud in position with the lower
tabs set into the slots of the lower radiator frame
(arrow, Figure 26).

Figure 26.
page 12

16. Slip the remaining belt over back groove of
waterpump pulley, power steering pulley, and
back groove of crankshaft pulley. Then, slide the
waterpump pulley (Figure 27) over the studs of
the waterpump. The belt is loose now, but will
tighten as the fan/clutch assembly is installed.

Figure 27.

when done!

17. Put on the fan/clutch assembly. Stuff a rag
between the fan and radiator to help hold the
fan in place as you tighten the 10 mm nuts
(Figure 28). A telescoping magnet (arrow, Figure
29) is useful for starting the nut on the stud, as
space is cramped. Use a 10 mm wrench to tighten the nuts (Figure 30), working opposite sides as
you go, to gradually pull the assembly firm
against the waterpump pulley. This tightens the
belt. Remove rag!
18. Insert fasteners atop fan shroud. Hook up
battery ground. Install underbelly pan. (You did
remove the rag, right?) Start engine.
Congratulations! You’re done!

Epilogue
Test drive your car. If it feels sluggish, especially going up hills, then you may have messed up the alignment marks. You can check for correct alignment by pulling the upper timing belt cover off. Rotate the
crankshaft so that the dot on the overhead camshaft aligns to the background mark (Figure 6). Shine a
flashlight into the chasm of lower timing belt cover and see if the notch on the front crankshaft shim
aligns to nub on front of engine (Figure 18C). If the marks do not align, you have no choice but to redo the
whole procedure again.
Once 600 miles have passed on the new belt, it needs to be tightened. Pry the rubber plug (arrow) out in
the upper timing belt cover (Figure 31). Loosen the 17 mm nut. Using the 24 mm socket, rotate the crankshaft 1X clockwise. Tighten the 17 mm nut. Press the rubber plug back in place. You’re done until another
49,400 miles have passed.
