073706 Factory Code 0 074106 Factory Code 1 074202 Factory Code 3 072508 Factory Code A
C1 Switch off ignition.
C2
I. - Manual fault tracing/calibration: Connect auxiliary lead (alternative 1 or 2 as illustrated) between
connector at front of seat to be tested and test lead on DLC A.
- Fault tracing/calibration using VST with OBD System Memory Cassette: Connect auxiliary lead to
terminal 6 on the VST adapter cable.
II. - Manual fault tracing/calibration: Connect test lead from DLC A to socket 6 on DLC B.
- Fault tracing/calibration using VST with OBD System Memory Cassette: Connect instrument to
DLC B.

C3
- Remove fuse No. 3
Fusebox is located behind ashtray in center console, in front of gear lever.
C4
Ignition must be off for at least 5 seconds before performing this step.

- Press and hold any button on control panel of seat to be tested while switching ignition on. Keep
button depressed for at least 1 second after turning on ignition.

C5
- Reinstall fuse No. 3.
Diagnostic system must now be activated within one minute, i.e., test button must be pressed once
to select DTM 1 (self-diagnostics) or four times to select DTM 4 (calibration).
Control module will exit diagnostic function after approx. 1 minute if no activity takes place between
module and DLC. Module will also exit diagnostic function if ignition is switched off for at least 5
seconds. Seat cannot be operated either with control buttons or memory buttons while using
diagnostic system.
Codes for DTM 1 are listed and explained in the table on page 9 of the SM; use of DTM 4
(calibration) is described on SM page 7.
Method For Version 4 (D)
960, 1993 4-door models as from chassis No. 018367 5-door models as from chassis No. 012113
Note:
Unlike earlier models, the power seats in the above models can be operated with the ignition off.
D1
- Switch off ignition.
D2
- Manual fault tracing/calibration: Connect test lead from DLC A to socket No. 6 on DLC B.
- Fault tracing/calibration with VST with OBD System Memory Cassette: Connect instrument to
DLC B.

Applies to: 960, 1992-1993 4-door models to chassis No. 018366 incl. 5-door models to chassis
No. 012112 incl.

Note:
Power seats in the above models can be operated only with the ignition on.
B1
- Switch off ignition
B2
- Manual fault tracing/calibration: Connect test lead from DLC A to socket No. 6 on DLC B.
- Fault tracing/calibration using VST with OBD System Memory Cassette: Connect instrument to
DLC B.
B3
Ignition must be off for at least 5 seconds before performing this step.
- Press and hold any button on control panel of seat to be tested while switching ignition on. Keep
button depressed for at least 1 second after turning on ignition.
B4
- Diagnostic system must now be activated within one minute, i.e., test button must be pressed
once to select DTM 1 (self-diagnostics) or four times to select DTM 4 (calibration).
Control module will exit diagnostic function after approx. 1 minute if no activity takes place between
module and DLC. Module will also exit diagnostic function if ignition is switched off for at least 5
seconds. Seat cannot be operated either with control buttons or memory buttons while using
diagnostic system.
Codes for DTM 1 are listed and explained in the table on page 9 of the SM; use of DTM 4
(calibration) is described on SM page 7.

- Press and hold any button on control panel of seat to be tested while switching ignition on. Keep
button depressed for at least 1 second after turning on ignition.
E4
- Diagnostic system must now be activated within 2 minutes, i.e., test button must be pressed once
to select DTM 1 (self-diagnostics) or four times to select DTM 4 (calibration).
Control module will exit diagnostic function after approx. 2 minutes if no activity takes place
between module and DLC. Module will also exit diagnostic function if ignition is switched off. Seat
cannot be operated either with control buttons or memory buttons while using diagnostic system.
Codes for DTM 1 are listed and explained in the table on page 9 of the SM; use of DTM 4
(calibration) is described on SM page 7.

The illustrated operation number may only be added to a claim in conjunction with a warrantable
repair within the respective area.

Power seats in the above models can be operated only with the ignition on.

A1
- Switch off ignition.
A2
- Manual fault tracing/calibration: Connect auxiliary lead between green lead (alternative 2, later
version) in connector at front of driver's seat and test lead on DLC (diagnostic unit) A.
On 940 without a green lead (alternative 1, earlier version), connect auxiliary lead to connector
terminal 4.
- Fault tracing/calibration using Volvo Scan Tool (VST) with On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) System
Memory Cassette: Connect auxiliary lead to terminal 6 on the VST adapter cable.
A3
Ignition must be off for at least 5 seconds before performing this step.
- Press and hold any button on control panel of seat to be tested while switching ignition on. Keep
button depressed for at least 1 second after turning on ignition.
A4
Diagnostic system must now be activated within 1 minute, i.e., test button must be pressed once to
select diagnostic test mode (DTM) 1 (self-diagnostics) or four times to select test mode 4
(calibration).
Control module will exit diagnostic function after approx. 1 minute if no activity takes place between
module and DLC. Module will also exit diagnostic function if ignition is switched off for at least 5
seconds. Seat cannot be operated either with control buttons or memory buttons while using

- Remove circuit breaker 35. Fusebox is located at left-hand end of dashboard.

D4
Ignition must be off for at least 5 seconds before performing this step.
- Press and hold any button on control panel of seat to be tested while switching ignition on. Keep
button depressed for at least 1 second after turning on ignition.
D5
- Reinstall circuit breaker 35.
Diagnostic system must now be activated within one minute, i.e., test button must be pressed once
to select DTM 1 (self-diagnostics) or four times to select DTM 4 (calibration).
- Control module will exit diagnostic function after approx. 1 minute if no activity takes place
between module and DLC. Module will also exit diagnostic function if ignition is switched off for at
least 5 seconds. Seat cannot be operated either with control buttons or memory buttons while
using diagnostic system.
Codes for DTM 1 are listed and explained in the table on page 9 of the SM; use of DTM 4
(calibration) is described on SM page 7.
Method For Version 5 (E)
Applies to: 940/960 from 1994 on
Unlike later 1993 variants, fault tracing or calibration of power seats in the above models can be
carried out without removing the fuses.
Note:
The seat can be operated with the ignition switched off.
E1
- Switch off ignition.
E2
- Manual fault tracing/calibration: Connect test lead from DLC A to socket No. 6 on DLC B.
- Fault tracing/calibration using VST with OBD System Memory Cassette: Connect instrument to
DLC B.

Alarm Module: Description and Operation
Guard Alarm II System Relay
The control module contains a pre-programmed microprocessor which can be reprogrammed for
different functions. It is possible to store up to four different key codes for each remote in the
micro-processor. There are three built-in relays for:
- Start inhibitor
- Visual signal
- Sound signal
