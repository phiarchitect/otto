Avoiding Trouble
Many procedures in this guide require you to "label and disconnect ... '' a group of lines, hoses or wires. Don't be lulled into thinking you can
remember where everything goes-you won't. If you hook up vacuum or fuel lines incorrectly, the vehicle may run poorly, if at all. If you hook
up electrical wiring incorrectly, you may instantly learn a very expensive lesson.

Print

You don't need to know the official or engineering name for each hose or line. A piece of masking tape on the hose and a piece on its fitting will allow you
to assign your own label such as the letter A or a short name. As long as you remember your own code, the lines can be reconnected by matching similar
letters or names. Do remember that tape will dissolve in gasoline or other fluids; if a component is to be washed or cleaned, use another method of
identification. A permanent felt-tipped marker or a metal scribe can be very handy for marking metal parts. Remove any tape or paper labels after
assembly.

Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes
Pay attention to the instructions provided. There are 3 common mistakes in mechanical work:

Print

1. Incorrect order of assembly, disassembly or adjustment. When taking something apart or putting it together, performing steps in the wrong order
usually just costs you extra time; however, it CAN break something. Read the entire procedure before beginning disassembly. Perform everything
in the order in which the instructions say you should, even if you can't immediately see a reason for it. When you're taking apart something that is
very intricate, you might want to draw a picture of how it looks when assembled at one point in order to make sure you get everything back in its
proper position. We will supply exploded views whenever possible. When making adjustments, perform them in the proper order. One adjustment
possibly will affect another.
2. Overtorquing (or undertorquing). While it is more common for overtorquing to cause damage, undertorquing may allow a fastener to vibrate loose
causing serious damage. Especially when dealing with aluminum parts, pay attention to torque specifications and utilize a torque wrench in
assembly. If a torque figure is not available, remember that if you are using the right tool to perform the job, you will probably not have to strain
yourself to get a fastener tight enough. The pitch of most threads is so slight that the tension you put on the wrench will be multiplied many times
in actual force on what you are tightening. A good example of how critical torque is can be seen in the case of spark plug installation, especially
where you are putting the plug into an aluminum cylinder head. Too little torque can fail to crush the gasket, causing leakage of combustion gases
and consequent overheating of the plug and engine parts. Too much torque can damage the threads or distort the plug, changing the spark gap.

There are many commercial products available for ensuring that fasteners won't come loose, even if they are not torqued just right (a very common
brand is LoctiteÂ®). If you're worried about getting something together tight enough to hold, but loose enough to avoid mechanical damage during
assembly, one of these products might offer substantial insurance. Before choosing a threadlocking compound, read the label on the package and make
sure the product is compatible with the materials, fluids, etc. involved.
3. Crossthreading. This occurs when a part such as a bolt is screwed into a nut or casting at the wrong angle and forced. Crossthreading is more likely
to occur if access is difficult. It helps to clean and lubricate fasteners, then to start threading the bolt, spark plug, etc. with your fingers. If you
encounter resistance, unscrew the part and start over again at a different angle until it can be inserted and turned several times without much
effort. Keep in mind that many parts, especially spark plugs, have tapered threads, so that gentle turning will automatically bring the part you're
threading to the proper angle. Don't put a wrench on the part until it's been tightened a couple of turns by hand. If you suddenly encounter
resistance, and the part has not seated fully, don't force it. Pull it back out to make sure it's clean and threading properly.

Be sure to take your time and be patient, and always plan ahead. Allow yourself ample time to perform repairs and maintenance. You may find
maintaining your car a satisfying and enjoyable experience.

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE
Repair guide for 1990-98 Volvo cars is intended to help you learn more about the inner workings of your vehicle while saving you money on
its upkeep and operation.

Print

The beginning of the guide will likely be referred to the most, since that is where you will find information for maintenance and tune-up. The other
sections deal with the more complex systems of your vehicle. Operating systems from engine through brakes are covered to the extent that the average
do-it-yourselfer becomes mechanically involved. this guide will not explain such things as rebuilding a differential for the simple reason that the expertise
required and the investment in special tools make this task uneconomical. It will, however, give you detailed instructions to help you change your own
brake pads and shoes, replace spark plugs, and perform many more jobs that can save you money, give you personal satisfaction and help you avoid
expensive problems.
A secondary purpose of this guide is a reference for owners who want to understand their vehicle and/or their mechanics better. In this case, no tools at
all are required.

Maintenance or RepairIt's necessary to mention the difference between maintenance and repair. Maintenance includes routine inspections, adjustments, and
Print
replacement of parts which show signs of normal wear. Maintenance compensates for wear or deterioration. Repair implies that something
has broken or is not working. A need for repair is often caused by lack of maintenance. Example: draining and refilling the automatic
transmission fluid is maintenance recommended by the manufacturer at specific mileage intervals. Failure to do this can shorten the life of the
transmission/transaxle, requiring very expensive repairs. While no maintenance program can prevent items from breaking or wearing out, a general rule
can be stated: MAINTENANCE IS CHEAPER THAN REPAIR.
Two basic mechanic's rules should be mentioned here. First, whenever the left side of the vehicle or engine is referred to, it is meant to specify the
driver's side. Conversely, the right side of the vehicle means the passenger's side. Second, screws and bolts are removed by turning counterclockwise,
and tightened by turning clockwise unless specifically noted.
Safety is always the most important rule. Constantly be aware of the dangers involved in working on an automobile and take the proper precautions. See
the information in this section regarding SERVICING YOUR VEHICLE SAFELY and the SAFETY NOTICE on the acknowledgment page.

Where to Begin
Before removing any bolts, read through the entire procedure. This will give you the overall view of what tools and supplies will be required.
There is nothing more frustrating than having to walk to the bus stop on Monday morning because you were short one bolt on Sunday
afternoon. So read ahead and plan ahead. Each operation should be approached logically and all procedures thoroughly understood before
attempting any work.

Print

All sections contain adjustments, maintenance, removal and installation procedures, and in some cases, repair or overhaul procedures. When repair is not
considered practical, we tell you how to remove the part and then how to install the new or rebuilt replacement. In this way, you at least save labor
costs. "Backyard" repair of some components is just not practical.

Diagnosis and Testing
SERVICE PRECAUTIONS

Print

The ignition system operates with a very high output and there are hazardous voltages in the low and high voltage circuits.
Always turn the ignition OFF , before separating connectors.
Never disconnect the battery while the engine is running.
Always disconnect the battery when quick charging the battery.
Never use a boost charger or voltage higher than 16 volts to start the engine.
Always remove the control unit if the vehicle is to be stove or if welding is to be carried out. The control unit must not be exposed to temperatures
above 176Â°F (80Â°C).
Do not replace a control unit without first correcting the original fault, or the same fault may damage the new control unit.
Do not be hasty in condemning the ECM. This system uses voltages and resistances that are very small. Examine the sensors, wiring and connectors
carefully. The sensors operate in more harsh conditions than the ECM which is generally in a more protected location.
Check all ground connections before condemning the ECM.
Use care when working around vehicles equipped with Supplementary Restraint System (SRS), often known as "air bags." Vehicles equipped with
SRS are generally recognized by the letters SRS molded into the steering wheel cover. Follow all precautions to avoid personal injury.
Before performing any component testing, check for and, if necessary, repair the following:

Damaged, corroded, contaminated, carbon tracked or worn distributor cap and rotor
Damaged, fouled, improperly seated or gapped spark plug(s)
Damaged or improperly engaged electrical connections, spark plug wires, etc.
Discharged battery
Blown fuses

SECONDARY SPARK TEST
The best way to perform this procedure is to use a spark tester (available at most automotive
parts stores). Two types of spark testers are commonly available. The Neon Bulb type is connected to the spark plug wire and flashes with each ignition
pulse. The Air Gap type must be adjusted to the individual spark plug gap specified for the engine. This type of tester allows the user to not only detect
the presence of spark, but also the intensity (orange/yellow is weak, blue is strong).
1. Disconnect a spark plug wire at the spark plug end.
2. Connect the plug wire to the spark tester and ground the tester to an appropriate location on the engine.
3. Crank the engine and check for spark at the tester.
4. If spark exists at the tester, the ignition system is functioning properly.
5. If spark does not exist at the spark plug wire, remove the distributor cap and ensure that the rotor is turning when the engine is cranked.
6. If the rotor is turning, perform the spark test again using the ignition coil wire.
7. If spark does not exist at the ignition coil wire, test the ignition coil, and other distributor related components or wiring. Repair or replace
components as necessary.

Distributor
On these Motronic systems, the distributor is essentially a rotor bolted onto the end of the intake camshaft. There is no distributor housing to
remove. Once the distributor cap is removed, the rotor can be removed from the camshaft. See General Information & Maintenance for
Distributor Cap and Rotor removal and installation.

General Information
See Figure 1

Print

The Motronic 4.3 and 4.4 system on 850/C70/S70/V70 models is a total control system. Both engine and ignition controls are incorporated
into one system with one control module. The control module receives the inputs from various sensors and controls all the outputs together.
The inputs that directly affect ignition include the RPM sensor (crankshaft position sensor), Camshaft Position (CMP) sensor, knock sensors, Engine
Coolant Temperature (ECT) sensor, Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor, acceleration sensor, Throttle Position (TP) sensor and, on vehicles equipped with an
automatic transaxle, a Transmission Control Module (TCM). The RPM and CMP sensors determine engine speed and directly affect ignition timing control.
The TP and MAF sensors, as well as the TCM, determine engine load. The knock sensor determines if the ignition timing is correct by detecting engine
knocks or pre-ignition, and the acceleration sensor determines if the vehicle is being driven on a bumpy or uneven surface, possibly causing faulty knock
sensor readings.
The system has a fail safe or limp home mode where it defaults to a predetermined timing and voltage level if an input device fails. The Malfunction
Indicator Lamp (MIL) will illuminate and the vehicle may exhibit more driveability problems; it should be diagnosed as soon as possible.

Do not remove the cylinder head by pulling straight up. Instead, lever the head off by inserting 2 spare head bolts into the front and rear inboard cylinder
head bolt holes and pulling toward the applicable wheel housing. Otherwise, the cylinder liners may be pulled up, breaking the lower liner seal and
leaking coolant into the crankcase. If any do pull up, new liner seals must be used and the crankcase completely drained. If the head(s) seem stuck,
gently tap around the edges of the head(s) with a rubber mallet, to break the joint.
51. Remove the head gasket.
52. Clean the contact surfaces with a plastic scraper and lacquer thinner.
53. If the head is going to be off for any length of time, install liner holders tool 999 5093 or 2 strips of thick stock steel with holes for the head bolts, so
the liners stay pressed down against their seals. Install the holders width-wise between the middle 4 head bolt holes.

REMOVAL & INSTALLATION

Print

In the process of removing the engine, you will come across a number of steps
which call for the removal of a separate component or system, such as disconnect the exhaust system'' or remove the radiator.'' In most instances, a
detailed removal procedure can be found elsewhere in this guide.
It is virtually impossible to list each individual wire and hose which must be disconnected, simply because so many different model and engine
combinations have been manufactured. Careful observation and common sense are the best possible approaches to any repair procedure.
Removal and installation of the engine can be made easier if you follow these basic points:

If you have to drain any of the fluids, use a suitable container.
Always tag any wires or hoses and, if possible, the components they came from before disconnecting them.
Because there are so many bolts and fasteners involved, store and label the retainers from components separately in muffin pans, jars or coffee
cans. This will prevent confusion during installation.
After unbolting the transmission or transaxle, always make sure it is properly supported.
If it is necessary to disconnect the air conditioning system, have this service performed by a qualified technician using a recovery/recycling station.
If the system does not have to be disconnected, unbolt the compressor and set it aside.
When unbolting the engine mounts, always make sure the engine is properly supported. When removing the engine, make sure that any lifting
devices are properly attached to the engine. It is recommended that if your engine is supplied with lifting hooks, your lifting apparatus be attached to
them.
Lift the engine from its compartment slowly, checking that no hoses, wires or other components are still connected.
After the engine is clear of the compartment, place it on an engine stand or workbench.
After the engine has been removed, you can perform a partial or full teardown of the engine using the procedures outlined in this guide.

Although Volvo recommends removing the engine and transmission as an assembly, transmissions can be left in the vehicle if desired. If choosing to
remove the engine only and leave the transmission in the vehicle, disregard the transmission, shifter, cables, driveshaft, and mount removal procedures.
In place of these procedures, the bell housing bolts must be removed, as well as the torque converter bolts, if equipped with an automatic transmission.
Also, a floorjack or other suitable support must be placed under the transmission.

Flywheel/Flexplate
REMOVAL & INSTALLATION

Print
See Figures 1 and 2

The ring gear is contacted by the starter gear during engine start up. If any damage is found on the ring gear (broken or chipped teeth, cracks, etc.) the
cause of the failure should be identified and repaired. The starter should be checked as a possible cause.
On vehicles with automatic transmission, the ring gear is an integral part of the flexplate and cannot be replaced. On vehicles with manual gearboxes, the
ring gear on the flywheel can be removed and replaced. This replacement involves heating the ring to 450Â°F, and handling the heated ring. It is usually
found to be easier to buy a complete flywheel and ring gear assembly than to attempt the replacement. If you possess the proper equipment for heating
and handling the ring gear, the procedure is as follows:
1. Disconnect the negative battery cable.
2. Raise and support the vehicle.
3. Remove the transmission, as described in Drive Train .
4. If equipped with a manual transmission/transaxle, remove the clutch plate and disc.
5. Remove the bolts attaching the flywheel or ring gear to the crankshaft flange.
6. Remove the flywheel or ring gear.

7. Inspect the flywheel for cracks, grooves, or bluing and inspect the ring gear for burrs or worn teeth.
8. Replace the flywheel or ring gear if any damage is apparent.
9. Remove burrs with a mill file.
10. To replace a ring gear, use the following steps.
A. Use a 10mm bit and drill a hole between two cogs (teeth) on the ring gear, being careful not to drill into the flywheel.
B. Mount the flywheel in a vise protected by soft jaws and split the ring gear at the hole with a chisel.
C. Heat the new ring gear to approximately 450Â°F (232Â°C). When handling the heated ring, wear heavy gloves and use tongs.
D. Position the ring gear with the beveled side facing the flywheel.
E. Use a brass drift and tap the ring gear until flush. Allow to air cool before installation; do not attempt to cool the metal with water, oil or other
fluids.

11. Install the flywheel.
12. Install the bolts and torque to specification in a crisscross pattern.
13. Install the transmission, as described in Drive Train .
14. Lower the vehicle.
15. Connect the negative battery cable.

Timing Belt and Sprockets
REMOVAL & INSTALLATION

Print

Although not necessary, replace the timing belt tensioner when replacing the belt.
The tensioner can (and often does) leak hydraulic fluid, and can seize, causing the belt to break.
B230F and B230FT Engines
1. Disconnect the negative battery cable.
2. Remove the timing belt cover as described in this section.
3. Set the engine to TDC of the No. 1 cylinder.
4. To remove the tension from the belt, loosen the nut for the tensioner and press the idler roller back. The tension spring can be locked in this
position by inserting the shank end of a 3mm drill through the pusher rod.
5. Remove the 6 retaining bolts and the crankshaft pulley.
6. Remove the belt, taking care not to bend it at any sharp angles. The belt should be replaced at 45,000 mile (72,500 km) intervals, if it becomes oil
soaked or frayed or if it is on a vehicle that has been sitting idle for any length of time.

To install:
7. If the crankshaft, idler shaft or camshaft were disturbed while the belt was out, align each shaft with its corresponding index mark to assure proper
valve timing and ignition timing, as follows:
A. Rotate the crankshaft so the notch in the convex crankshaft gear belt guide aligns with the embossed mark on the front cover (12 o'clock
position).
B. Rotate the idler shaft so the dot on the idler shaft drive sprocket aligns with the notch on the timing belt rear cover (4 o'clock position).
C. Rotate the camshaft so the notch in the camshaft sprocket inner belt guide aligns with the notch in the forward edge of the valve cover (12
o'clock position).

8. Install the timing belt (don't use any sharp tools) over the sprockets and then over the tensioner roller. Some new belts have yellow marks. The 2
lines on the drive belt should fit toward the crankshaft marks. The next mark should then fit toward the intermediate shaft marks, etc.
9. Loosen the tensioner nut and let the spring tension automatically take up the slack. Tighten the tensioner nut to 37 ft. lbs. (51 Nm).
10. Rotate the crankshaft one full revolution clockwise and make sure the timing marks still align.
11. Install the drive belts, radiator fan and shroud.
12. Connect the negative battery cable.

B234F Engine
See Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8

The B234F engine has 2 timing belts, one driving the camshafts and one driving the balance shafts. The camshaft belt may be removed separately; the
balance shaft belt requires removal of the camshaft belt. During reassembly, the exact placement of the belts and pulleys must be observed.
1. Remove the negative battery cable.
2. Remove the timing belt covers.
3. Turn the engine to TDC, of the compression stroke, on cylinder No. 1. Make sure the marks on the cam pulleys align with the marks on the backing
plate and that the marking on the belt guide plate (on the crankshaft) is opposite the TDC mark on the engine block.
4. Remove the protective cap over the timing belt tensioner locknut. Loosen the locknut, compress the tensioner, to release tension on the belts, and
re-tighten the locknut, holding the tensioner in place.
5. Remove the timing belt from the camshafts. Do not crease or fold the belt. Place a mark noting the direction of the belts rotation if you are
reinstalling the same belt.

The camshafts and the crankshaft must not be moved when the belt is removed.
6. Check the tensioner by spinning it counterclockwise and listening for any bearing noise within. Check also that the belt contact surface is clean and
smooth. In the same fashion, check the timing belt idler pulleys. Make sure the bolts are tightened to 18.5 ft. lbs. (25 Nm).
7. If the balance shaft belt is to be removed:
A. Remove the balance shaft belt idler pulley from the engine.
B. Loosen the locknut on the tensioner and remove the belt. Slide the belt under the crankshaft pulley assembly. Check the tensioner and idler
wheels carefully for any sign of contamination; check the ends of the shafts for any sign of oil leakage.
C. Check the position of the balance shafts and the crankshaft after belt removal. The balance shaft markings on the pulleys should align with the
markings on the backing plate and the crankshaft marking should still be aligned with the TDC mark on the engine block.
D. When refitting the balance shaft belt, observe that the belt has colored dots on it. These marks assist in the critical placement of the belt. The
yellow dot will align the right lower shaft, the blue dot will align on the crank and the other yellow dot will match to the upper left balance
shaft.
E. Carefully work the belt in under the crankshaft pulley. Make sure the blue dot is opposite the bottom (TDC) marking on the belt guide plate at
the bottom of the crankshaft. Fit the belt around the left upper balance shaft pulley, making sure the yellow mark is opposite the mark on the
pulley. Install the belt around the right lower balance shaft pulley and again check that the mark on the belt aligns with the mark on the
pulley.
F. Work the belt around the tensioner. Double check that all the markings are still aligned.
G. Set the belt tension by inserting an Allen key into the adjusting hole in the tensioner. Turn the crankshaft carefully through a few degrees on
either side of TDC to check that the belt has properly engaged the pulleys. Return the crank to the TDC position and set the adjusting hole just
below the 3 o'clock position when tightening the adjusting bolt. Use the Allen wrench, in the adjusting hole, as a counter hold and tighten the
locking bolt to 29.5 ft. lbs. (40 Nm).
H. Check the tension of the belt. If the belt is out of specification, the belt must be readjusted.

To install:
8. Reinstall the camshaft belt by aligning the double line marking on the belt with the top marking on the belt guide plate at the top of the crankshaft.
Stretch the belt around the crank pulley and place it over the tensioner and the right side idler. Place the belt on the camshaft pulleys. The single
line marks on the belt should align exactly with the pulley markings. Route the belt around the oil pump drive pulley and press the belt onto the left
side idler.
9. Check that all the markings align and that the engine is still positioned at TDC, of the compression stroke, for cylinder No. 1.
10. Loosen the tensioner locknut.
11. Turn the crankshaft clockwise. The cam pulleys should rotate 1 full turn until the marks again align with the marks on the backing plate.

The engine must not be rotated counterclockwise during this procedure.
12. Smoothly rotate the crankshaft further clockwise until the cam pulley markings are 1

1

/ 2 teeth beyond the marks on the backing plate.

13. Tighten the tensioner locknut.
14. Check the tension on the balance shaft belt; it should now be 3.8 units. If the tension is too low, adjust the tensioner clockwise. If the tension is too
high, repeat Step 7g.
15. Check the belt guide for the balance shaft belt and make sure it is properly seated.
16. Install the center timing belt cover, the one that covers the tensioner, the fan shroud, fan pulley and fan.
17. Install all the drive belts and connect the battery cable.
18. Double check all installation items, paying particular attention to loose hoses or hanging wires, untightened nuts, poor routing of hoses and wires
(too tight or rubbing) and tools left in the engine area.
19. Connect the negative battery cable.
20. Start the engine and allow it to run until the thermostat opens.

CAUTION
The upper and lower timing belt covers are still removed. The belt and pulleys are exposed and moving at high speed.

21. Turn the engine OFF and bring the engine to TDC, of the compression stroke, on cylinder No. 1.
22. Disconnect the negative battery cable.
23. Check the tension of the camshaft belt. Position the gauge between the right (exhaust) cam pulley and the idler. Belt tension must be 5.5 plus or
minus 0.2 units. If the belt needs adjustment, remove the rubber cap over the tensioner locknut, cap is located on the timing belt cover, and loosen
the locknut.
24. Insert a suitable tool between the tensioner wheel and the spring carrier pin to hold the tensioner. If the belt needs to be tightened, move the roller
to adjust the tension to 6.0 units. If the belt is too tight, adjust to obtain a reading of 5.0 units on the gauge. Tighten the tensioner locknut.
25. Rotate the crankshaft so the cam pulleys move through 1 full revolution and recheck the tension on the camshaft belt. It should now be 5.5 plus or
minus 0.2 units. Install the plastic plug over the tensioner bolt.
26. Final check the tension on the balance shaft belt by fitting the gauge and turning the tensioner clockwise. Only small movements are needed. After
any needed readjustments, rotate the crankshaft clockwise through 1 full revolution and recheck the balance shaft belt. The tension should now be
on the final specification of 4.9 plus or minus 0.2 units.
27. Install the idler pulley for the balance shaft belt.
28. Reinstall the upper and lower timing belt covers.
29. Connect the negative battery cable.
30. Start the engine and final check performance.

INSPECTION

See Figures 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30

The timing belt should be periodically inspected for wear. Removal of the timing cover is necessary to visually check the belt for signs of wear or
contamination. The belt should show no signs of wear such as cracked teeth, wear on the belt face, wear on one or both sides of the belt, and there
should be no foreign materials on the belt or between the teeth. If there is oil, coolant, lubricant, or any other foreign material on the belt, it is a good
idea to replace the belt due to the fact that rapid wear can result from this contamination. Usually sticking to the manufacturers guide for timing belt
replacement interval will ensure little problems but it is still a good idea to periodically inspect your belt. If the belt breaks the engine will shut down and
serious engine damage can occur. The proper manufacturer recommended timing belt replacement interval can be found in General Information &
Maintenance .

Driveability & Emissions Controls
Volvo 240/740/760/780/940/960 1990-1998

AIR POLLUTION
The earth's atmosphere, at or near sea level, consists approximately of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other gases. If
it were possible to remain in this state, 100 percent clean air would result. However, many varied sources allow other gases and particulates
to mix with the clean air, causing our atmosphere to become unclean or polluted.

Print

Some of these pollutants are visible while others are invisible, with each having the capability of causing distress to the eyes, ears, throat, skin and
respiratory system. Should these pollutants become concentrated in a specific area and under certain conditions, death could result due to the
displacement or chemical change of the oxygen content in the air. These pollutants can also cause great damage to the environment and to the many
man made objects that are exposed to the elements.
To better understand the causes of air pollution, the pollutants can be categorized into 3 separate types, natural, industrial and automotive.
Back to Top

Volvo 240/740/760/780/940/960 1990-1998

Automotive Pollutants
The third major source of air pollution is automotive emissions. The emissions from the internal combustion engines were not an appreciable
Print
problem years ago because of the small number of registered vehicles and the nation's small highway system. However, during the early
1950's, the trend of the American people was to move from the cities to the surrounding suburbs. This caused an immediate problem in
transportation because the majority of suburbs were not afforded mass transit conveniences. This lack of transportation created an attractive market for
the automobile manufacturers, which resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of vehicles produced and sold, along with a marked increase in
highway construction between cities and the suburbs. Multi-vehicle families emerged with a growing emphasis placed on an individual vehicle per family
member. As the increase in vehicle ownership and usage occurred, so did pollutant levels in and around the cities, as suburbanites drove daily to their
businesses and employment, returning at the end of the day to their homes in the suburbs.
It was noted that a smoke and fog type haze was being formed and at times, remained in suspension over the cities, taking time to dissipate. At first this
"smog,'' derived from the words "smoke'' and "fog,'' was thought to result from industrial pollution but it was determined that automobile emissions
shared the blame. It was discovered that when normal automobile emissions were exposed to sunlight for a period of time, complex chemical reactions
would take place.
It is now known that smog is a photo chemical layer which develops when certain oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) from
automobile emissions are exposed to sunlight. Pollution was more severe when smog would become stagnant over an area in which a warm layer of air
settled over the top of the cooler air mass, trapping and holding the cooler mass at ground level. The trapped cooler air would keep the emissions from
being dispersed and diluted through normal air flows. This type of air stagnation was given the name "Temperature Inversion.''

TEMPERATURE INVERSION
In normal weather situations, surface air is warmed by heat radiating from the earth's surface
and the sun's rays. This causes it to rise upward, into the atmosphere. Upon rising it will cool through a convection type heat exchange with the cooler
upper air. As warm air rises, the surface pollutants are carried upward and dissipated into the atmosphere.
When a temperature inversion occurs, we find the higher air is no longer cooler, but is warmer than the surface air, causing the cooler surface air to
become trapped. This warm air blanket can extend from above ground level to a few hundred or even a few thousand feet into the air. As the surface air
is trapped, so are the pollutants, causing a severe smog condition. Should this stagnant air mass extend to a few thousand feet high, enough air
movement with the inversion takes place to allow the smog layer to rise above ground level but the pollutants still cannot dissipate. This inversion can
remain for days over an area, with the smog level only rising or lowering from ground level to a few hundred feet high. Meanwhile, the pollutant levels
increase, causing eye irritation, respiratory problems, reduced visibility, plant damage and in some cases, even disease.
This inversion phenomenon was first noted in the Los Angeles, California area. The city lies in terrain resembling a basin and with certain weather
conditions, a cold air mass is held in the basin while a warmer air mass covers it like a lid.
Because this type of condition was first documented as prevalent in the Los Angeles area, this type of trapped pollution was named Los Angeles Smog,
although it occurs in other areas where a large concentration of automobiles are used and the air remains stagnant for any length of time.

HEAT TRANSFER
Consider the internal combustion engine as a machine in which raw materials must be placed so a finished product
comes out. As in any machine operation, a certain amount of wasted material is formed. When we relate this to the internal combustion engine, we find
that through the input of air and fuel, we obtain power during the combustion process to drive the vehicle. The by-product or waste of this power is, in
part, heat and exhaust gases with which we must dispose.
The heat from the combustion process can rise to over 4000Â°F (2204Â°C). The dissipation of this heat is controlled by a ram air effect, the use of cooling
fans to cause air flow and a liquid coolant solution surrounding the combustion area to transfer the heat of combustion through the cylinder walls and into
the coolant. The coolant is then directed to a thin-finned, multi-tubed radiator, from which the excess heat is transferred to the atmosphere by 1 of the 3
heat transfer methods, conduction, convection or radiation.
The cooling of the combustion area is an important part in the control of exhaust emissions. To understand the behavior of the combustion and transfer of
its heat, consider the air/fuel charge. It is ignited and the flame front burns progressively across the combustion chamber until the burning charge
reaches the cylinder walls. Some of the fuel in contact with the walls is not hot enough to burn, thereby snuffing out or quenching the combustion
process. This leaves unburned fuel in the combustion chamber. This unburned fuel is then forced out of the cylinder and into the exhaust system, along
with the exhaust gases.
Many attempts have been made to minimize the amount of unburned fuel in the combustion chambers due to quenching, by increasing the coolant
temperature and lessening the contact area of the coolant around the combustion area. However, design limitations within the combustion chambers
prevent the complete burning of the air/fuel charge, so a certain amount of the unburned fuel is still expelled into the exhaust system, regardless of
modifications to the engine.

Volvo 240/740/760/780/940/960 1990-1998

Industrial Pollutants
Industrial pollution is caused primarily by industrial processes, the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, which in turn produce smoke and
Print
fumes. Because the burning fuels contain large amounts of sulfur, the principal ingredients of smoke and fumes are sulfur dioxide and
particulate matter. This type of pollutant occurs most severely during still, damp and cool weather, such as at night. Even in its less severe
form, this pollutant is not confined to just cities. Because of air movements, the pollutants move for miles over the surrounding countryside, leaving in its
path a barren and unhealthy environment for all living things.
Working with Federal, State and Local mandated regulations and by carefully monitoring emissions, big business has greatly reduced the amount of
pollutant introduced from its industrial sources, striving to obtain an acceptable level. Because of the mandated industrial emission clean up, many land
areas and streams in and around the cities that were formerly barren of vegetation and life, have now begun to move back in the direction of nature's
intended balance.

Volvo 240/740/760/780/940/960 1990-1998

Natural Pollutants
Natural pollution has been present on earth since before man appeared and continues to be a factor when discussing air pollution, although
it causes only a small percen tage of the overall pollution problem. It is the direct result of decaying organic matter, wind born smoke and
particulates from such natural events as plain and forest fires (ignited by heat or lightning), volcanic ash, sand and dust which can spread
over a large area of the countryside.

Print

Such a phenomenon of natural pollution has been seen in the form of volcanic eruptions, with the resulting plume of smoke, steam and volcanic ash
blotting out the sun's rays as it spreads and rises higher into the atmosphere. As it travels into the atmosphere the upper air currents catch and carry the
smoke and ash, while condensing the steam back into water vapor. As the water vapor, smoke and ash travel on their journey, the smoke dissipates into
the atmosphere while the ash and moisture settle back to earth in a trail hundreds of miles long. In some cases, lives are lost and millions of dollars of
property damage result.

BASIC FUEL SYSTEM DIAGNOSIS
When there is a problem starting or driving a vehicle, two of the most important checks involve the ignition and the fuel systems. The
questions most mechanics attempt to answer first, "is there spark-'' and "is there fuel-'' will often lead to solving most basic problems. For
ignition system diagnosis and testing, please refer to the information on engine electrical components and ignition systems found earlier in
this guide. If the ignition system checks out (there is spark), then you must determine if the fuel system is operating properly (is there fuel-).

General Information
See Figures 1 and 2

Print

The air bag system used on Volvo vehicles is referred to as Supplemental Restraint System (SRS). The SRS system provides additional
protection for the driver, if a forward collision of sufficient force is encountered. The SRS assists the normal seat belt restraining system by deploying an
air bag, via the steering wheel and, on some models, the passenger side of the dashboard.
The system also includes a knee bolster at the lower steering column area. It is used to absorb energy and control the driver's forward movement during
an accident by limiting leg movement.
The system also includes a battery voltage check. The SRS warning lamp will illuminate, if the voltage falls below 9 volts. When the voltage rises above 9
volts again, the lamp will be go out after approximately 10 seconds.
The SRS system is monitored continuously by a microprocessor in the crash sensor. Any fault which is detected is stored in the memory and the SRS
warning lamp will turn ON.
Some later Volvo models are equipped with a Side Impact Protection System (SIPS). Vehicles equipped with SIPS will contain a decal possibly located on
the front windshield, drivers side of the instrument panel, below the seat pocket, or on the drivers side B-pillar.
The object of the SIPS system is to protect the occupants in the event of certain side-impact accidents. An air bag is deployed to cushion the impact
against the outer side of the vehicle. This system uses sensor mounted in the seat bottom, just outside the seat track. If an accident occurs, the bag could
deploy, triggered based upon information gathered by the crash sensor measuring the violence of the collision. This sophisticated process occurs in
milliseconds.
The SIPS system is not part of the SRS system and has its own function, in fact unlike the SRS system, the SIPS system can deploy one side without
deploying the other, depending on which side the impact occurs.

Fig. Fig. 1: This label is a reminder of the presence of a Supplemental Restraint System (SRS); be sure to heed the information

Fig. Fig. 2: This label is a notification of the presence of a Side Impact Protection System (SIPS); again, note the service
requirements

SYSTEM OPERATION
Under normal conditions, the SRS warning lamp will come ON when the ignition switch is turned to the ON
position. If the engine is not started, the lamp will be extinguished after approximately 10 seconds. Failure of the warning lamp to go OFF, while driving,
indicates a fault in the SRS system. The warning lamp will remain lit until the fault is corrected and the memory cleared.
The crash sensor records a combination of G-force and prolong deceleration. When a sufficiently high G-force and prolong deceleration are
simultaneously recorded, the power unit will deliver a current which will trigger the gas generator of the inflatable bag. The bag will be filled in a few
hundredths of a second with non-toxic nitrogen. Immediately after the collision, the gas is released through a ventilation hole and the air bag slowly
collapses. The entire sequence of inflation and collapse takes approximately 0.2 milliseconds.
The SIPS system works very similar to the SRS, however the SIPS is completely mechanical. Only three components per side of the vehicle are used. The
crash sensor operates very similar to the SRS and activates when an impact of the deformed door hits the sensor at a speed greater than 2 milliseconds
or 6.6 ft. per second. No electricity is used, the crash sensor deploys an igniter that uses a charge very similar to the way a shotgun is fired to fill the bag.
The SIPS bag deploys and breaks through the seat cushion SIPS module cover. A stitch seam in the seat is strategically placed to aid in this process. The
bag deploys toward the door to help protect the driver/passengers rib cage during a side-impact collision. There is a vent on the underside of the bag
which will allow the bag to deflate slowly, acting as a brake on the driver/passenger.

SERVICE PRECAUTIONS
Since the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) is such a complex and critical safety system (which
requires special precautions when repairs are being made), Volvo recommends that all repairs to the SRS system be performed by Volvo SRS-trained
technicians.
CAUTION
To avoid deployment when servicing the SRS system or components in the immediate area, do not use electrical test equipment such as battery or AC
powered voltmeter, ohmmeter, etc. or any type of tester other than specified. Do not use a non-powered probe tester. To avoid personal injury all
precautions must be strictly adhered to.

All work which includes removing or replacing the air bag assembly must be carried out with the battery disconnected and with the ignition turned
OFF for the duration of work. This is to ensure that the air bag does not accidentally inflate during service repairs and that no faults codes will register,
requiring subsequent cancellation.
When working around the instrument panel or steering column, take special care to ensure that the SRS wiring are not pinched, chafed or
penetrated by bolts/screws, etc. This is most likely to happen when installing the sound insulation, knee bolsters, ignition lock or steering column
cover.
For air bag fault tracing purposes and/or to check the system, use multimeter 999 6525 and test resistor 998 86595 or their equivalents.
Do not disassemble or tamper with the air bag assembly.
Always store a removed air bag assembly with the pad surface upwards.
Never install used SRS parts from another vehicle.
Never replace the original steering wheel with any other design, since it will make it impossible to properly install the air bag.

Always detach the yellow SRS connector when performing any diagnostic troubleshooting or service procedure associated with the SRS system.
When repairs are made to the front suspension and steering, be aware that the contact reel can only withstand being turned 3 turns in either
direction.
Never install an air bag assembly that shows signs of being dropped or improperly handled, such as dents, cracks or deformation.
When replacing a sensor, the replacement unit should be installed with the directional arrow oriented.

CV-JOINTS OVERHAUL
See Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21
These vehicles use several different types of joints. Engine size, transaxle type, whether the joint is an inboard or outboard joint, even which side of the
vehicle is being serviced could make a difference in joint type. Be sure to properly identify the joint before attempting joint or boot replacement. Look for
identification numbers at the large end of the boots and/or on the end of the metal retainer bands.
The 3 types of joints used are the Birfield Joint, (B.J.), the Tripod Joint (T.J.) and the Double Offset Joint (D.O.J.).

Do not disassemble a Birfield joint. Service with a new joint or clean and repack using a new boot kit.
The distance between the large and small boot bands is important and should be checked prior to and after boot service. This is so the boot will not be
installed either too loose or too tight, which could cause early wear and cracking, allowing the grease to get out and water and dirt in, leading to early
joint failure.

The driveshaft joints use special grease; do not add any grease other than that supplied with the kit.
Double Offset Joint
The Double Offset Joint (D.O.J.) is bigger than other joints and, in these applications, is normally used as an inboard joint.
1. Remove the halfshaft from the vehicle.
2. Side cutter pliers can be used to cut the metal retaining bands. Remove the boot from the joint outer race.
3. Locate and remove the large circlip at the base of the joint. Remove the outer race (the body of the joint).
4. Remove the small snapring and take off the inner race, cage and balls as an assembly. Clean the inner race, cage and balls without disassembling.
5. If the boot is to be reused, wipe the grease from the splines and wrap the splines in vinyl tape before sliding the boot from the shaft.
6. Remove the inner (D.O.J.) boot from the shaft. If the outer (B.J.) boot is to be replaced, remove the boot retainer rings and slide the boot down and
off of the shaft at this time.

To install:
7. Be sure to tape the shaft splines before installing the boots. Fill the inside of the boot with the specified grease. Often the grease supplied in the
replacement parts kit is meant to be divided in half, with half being used to lubricate the joint and half being used inside the boot.
8. Install the cage onto the halfshaft so the small diameter side of the cage is installed first. With a brass drift pin, tap lightly and evenly around the
inner race to install the race until it comes into contact with the rib of the shaft. Apply the specified grease to the inner race and cage and fit them
together. Insert the balls into the cage.
9. Install the outer race (the body of the joint) after filling with the specified grease. The outer race should be filled with this grease.
10. Tighten the boot bands securely. Make sure the distance between the boot bands is correct.
11. Install the halfshaft to the vehicle.

Except Double Offset Joint
1. Disconnect the negative battery cable. Remove the halfshaft.
2. Use side cutter pliers to remove the metal retaining bands from the boot(s) that will be removed. Slide the boot from the T.J. case.
3. Remove the snapring and the tripod joint spider assembly from the halfshaft. Do not disassemble the spider and use care in handling.
4. If the boot is be reused, wrap vinyl tape around the spline part of the shaft so the boot(s) will not be damaged when removed. Remove the dynamic
damper, if used, and the boots from the shaft.

To install:
5. Double check that the correct replacement parts are being installed. Wrap vinyl tape around the splines to protect the boot and install the boots
and damper, if used, in the correct order.
6. Install the joint spider assembly to the shaft and install the snapring.
7. Fill the inside of the boot with the specified grease. Often the grease supplied in the replacement parts kit is meant to be divided in half, with half

being used to lubricate the joint and half being used inside the boot. Keep grease off the rubber part of the dynamic damper (if used).
8. Secure the boot bands with the halfshaft in a horizontal position. Make sure distance between boot bands is correct.
9. Install the halfshaft to the vehicle and reconnect the negative battery cable.

Understanding the Manual Transaxle
Because of the way an internal combustion engine breathes, it can produce torque, or twisting force, only within a narrow speed range. Most
modern, overhead valve pushrod engines must turn at about 2500 rpm to produce their peak torque. By 4500 rpm they are producing so
little torque that continued increases in engine speed produce no power increases. The torque peak on overhead camshaft engines is
generally much higher, but much narrower.

Print

The manual transaxle and clutch are employed to vary the relationship between engine speed and the speed of the wheels so that adequate engine
power can be produced under all circumstances. The clutch allows engine torque to be applied to the transaxle input shaft gradually, due to mechanical
slippage. Consequently, the vehicle may be started smoothly from a full stop. The transaxle changes the ratio between the rotating speeds of the engine
and the wheels by the use of gears. The gear ratios allow full engine power to be applied to the wheels during acceleration at low speeds and at
highway/passing speeds.
In a front wheel drive transaxle, power is usually transmitted from the input shaft to a mainshaft or output shaft located slightly beneath and to the side
of the input shaft. The gears of the mainshaft mesh with gears on the input shaft, allowing power to be carried from one to the other. All forward gears
are in constant mesh and are free from rotating with the shaft unless the synchronizer and clutch is engaged. Shifting from one gear to the next causes
one of the gears to be freed from rotating with the shaft and locks another to it. Gears are locked and unlocked by internal dog clutches which slide
between the center of the gear and the shaft. The forward gears employ synchronizers; friction members which smoothly bring gear and shaft to the
same speed before the toothed dog clutches are engaged.

Sway Bar
The sway bar, variously called the anti-roll bar or stabilizer bar, serves to control the sideways roll of the body during cornering. While the bar
itself rarely fails, the links and bushings around it are prone to wear. If the bar is not rigidly mounted to the vehicle, it cannot do its job
properly.

Print

Sway bars of different diameters (thickness) can stiffen or soften the roll characteristics of a vehicle. Bushings are easily replaced and well worth the
effort in terms of restoring proper cornering manners to your vehicle.

Wheel Alignment
If the tires are worn unevenly, if the vehicle is not stable on the highway or if the handling seems uneven in spirited driving, the wheel
Print
alignment should be checked. If an alignment problem is suspected, first check for improper tire inflation and other possible causes. These
can be worn suspension or steering components, accident damage or even unmatched tires. If any worn or damaged components are found,
they must be replaced before the wheels can be properly aligned. Wheel alignment requires very expensive equipment and involves minute adjustments
which must be accurate; it should only be performed by a trained technician. Take your vehicle to a properly equipped shop.
Following is a description of the alignment angles which are adjustable on most vehicles and how they affect vehicle handling. Although these angles can
apply to both the front and rear wheels, usually only the front suspension is adjustable.

CASTER
See Figure 1
Looking at a vehicle from the side, caster angle describes the steering axis rather than a wheel angle. The steering knuckle is attached to a control arm
or strut at the top and a control arm at the bottom. The wheel pivots around the line between these points to steer the vehicle. When the upper point is
tilted back, this is described as positive caster. Having a positive caster tends to make the wheels self-centering, increasing directional stability.
Excessive positive caster makes the wheels hard to steer, while an uneven caster will cause a pull to one side. Overloading the vehicle or sagging rear
springs will affect caster, as will raising the rear of the vehicle. If the rear of the vehicle is lower than normal, the caster becomes more positive.

Fig. Fig. 1: Caster affects straight-line stability. Caster wheels used on shopping carts, for example, employ positive caster

CAMBER
See Figure 2
Looking from the front of the vehicle, camber is the inward or outward tilt of the top of wheels. When the tops of the wheels are tilted in, this is negative
camber; if they are tilted out, it is positive. In a turn, a slight amount of negative camber helps maximize contact of the tire with the road. However, too
much negative camber compromises straight-line stability, increases bump steer and torque steer.

Fig. Fig. 2: Camber influences tire contact with the road

TOE
See Figure 3
Looking down at the wheels from above the vehicle, toe angle is the distance between the front of the wheels, relative to the distance between the back
of the wheels. If the wheels are closer at the front, they are said to be toed-in or to have negative toe. A small amount of negative toe enhances
directional stability and provides a smoother ride on the highway.

Fig. Fig. 3: With toe-in, the distance between the wheels is closer at the front than at the rear

OVERHAUL
See Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10

Some vehicles may be equipped dual piston calipers. The procedure to overhaul the caliper is essentially the same with the exception of multiple pistons,
O-rings and dust boots.
1. Remove the caliper from the vehicle and place on a clean workbench.

CAUTION
NEVER place your fingers in front of the pistons in an attempt to catch or protect the pistons when applying compressed air. This could result in personal
injury!

Depending upon the vehicle, there are two different ways to remove the piston from the caliper. Refer to the brake pad replacement procedure to make
sure you have the correct procedure for your vehicle.
2. The first method is as follows:
A. Stuff a shop towel or a block of wood into the caliper to catch the piston.
B. Remove the caliper piston using compressed air applied into the caliper inlet hole. Inspect the piston for scoring, nicks, corrosion and/or worn
or damaged chrome plating. The piston must be replaced if any of these conditions are found.

Fig. Fig. 3: For some types of calipers, use compressed air to drive the piston out of the caliper, but be sure to keep your fingers clear

Fig. Fig. 4: Withdraw the piston from the caliper bore

3. For the second method, you must rotate the piston to retract it from the caliper.
4. If equipped, remove the anti-rattle clip.

Fig. Fig. 5: On some vehicles, you must remove the anti-rattle clip
5. Use a prytool to remove the caliper boot, being careful not to scratch the housing bore.

Fig. Fig. 6: Use a prytool to carefully pry around the edge of the boot ...

Fig. Fig. 7: ... then remove the boot from the caliper housing, taking care not to score or damage the bore
6. Remove the piston seals from the groove in the caliper bore.

Fig. Fig. 8: Use extreme caution when removing the piston seal; DO NOT scratch the caliper bore
7. Carefully loosen the brake bleeder valve cap and valve from the caliper housing.
8. Inspect the caliper bores, pistons and mounting threads for scoring or excessive wear.
9. Use crocus cloth to polish out light corrosion from the piston and bore.
10. Clean all parts with denatured alcohol and dry with compressed air.

To assemble:
11. Lubricate and install the bleeder valve and cap.
12. Install the new seals into the caliper bore grooves, making sure they are not twisted.
13. Lubricate the piston bore.
14. Install the pistons and boots into the bores of the calipers and push to the bottom of the bores.

Doors
REMOVAL & INSTALLATION

Print

The doors are heavy! Provide proper support for the door when removing. Do not
allow the door to sag while partially attached and do not subject the door to impact or twisting movements.
1. Disconnect the negative battery cable.
2. Disconnect any wiring harnesses running into the door. This may be done either inside the door (remove the door panel) or under the dashboard,

inside the pillar. Make sure the wiring harness will not catch or bind as the door is removed from the vehicle.
3. Scribe marks around the hinges to facilitate door installation.
4. Support the door with a jack. Place a piece of wood on the jack to protect the paintwork.
5. Have a helper support the door, then loosen and remove the hinge mounting bolts and remove the door from the vehicle.

To install:
6. With an assistant, position the door and install the hinge bolts. Do not fully tighten the hinge mounting bolts at this time.
7. Check the door for proper alignment. If required, loosen the mounting bolts just enough to allow the door to be moved into position.
8. Tighten all the hinge bolts and check the final fit.
9. If the door stop bracket was removed, reinstall it.
10. Connect the wiring harness and check the function of electrical components in the door. Install the door panel if removed.
11. Connect the negative battery cable.

ADJUSTMENT
See Figure 1
The primary door adjustments are carried out at the hinge bolts at the forward end of each door. Further adjustment for the closed position and for
latching smoothness may be made at the latch plate or striker. This piece is located at the rear edge of the door and is attached to the bodywork of the
vehicle; it is the piece which the door engages when closed.
Although the striker or latchplate is different on various models, the adjustment procedure is the same:
1. Adjust the position of the door by moving the striker plate sideways.
2. If further adjustments are necessary, first slacken the upper door hinge bolts, then, if necessary, the lower 2 bolts. Push the door toward the body.

Never loosen more than 3 bolts at a time or the door may drop. Do not attempt to correct height variations (sag) by adjusting the striker.
3. After the striker bolts have been tightened, open and close the door several times. Observe the motion of the door as it engages the striker; it
should continue its straight-in motion and not deflect up or down as it hits the striker.
4. Check the feel of the latch during opening and closing. It must be smooth and linear, without any trace of grinding or binding during engagement
and release.

It may be necessary to repeat the striker adjustment procedure several times (and possibly adjust the hinges) before the proper door-to-body alignment
is corrected.

5. Place the lid into position and lightly tighten the bolts until snug.
6. Check the lid-to-body alignment and adjust the trunk lid as necessary.
7. Final-tighten the bolts.

8. Reattach the gas shock to the trunk lid and reconnect the wiring, if any.

Wagon (5-Door Model)
Because of the size and weight of the liftgate, this procedure requires 2 people during removal and installation.
1. Remove the inner cover panel on the liftgate.
2. Detach any electrical connectors within the liftgate. Tag or identify the connectors for ease of reassembly.
3. Pull the harness through the hole in the top of the liftgate.
4. While your helper supports the liftgate, disconnect the gas shock(s).
5. With the liftgate safely supported, remove the liftgate-to-hinge bolts on each side at the top. On the 740, one of the bolts is beneath a rubber plug
which must be removed.
6. Remove the liftgate from the vehicle and store it on pads.

To install:
7. Place the liftgate into position and loosely tighten the bolts until snug.
8. Check the alignment of the liftgate in relation to the body, and adjust it as necessary.
9. When the alignment is correct, final-tighten the hinge bolts. Left-right alignment is critical. Take your time and work for an even fit.
10. Connect the gas shock(s) to the liftgate.
11. Feed the wire harness through the hole at the top of the liftgate and into position.
12. Connect the wires to the proper points.

ALIGNMENT
All Models
Both trunk lids and wagon liftgates are adjustable on their hinges due to slotted holes. The trunk lids are also adjustable by loosening the hinge-to-body
bolts and repositioning the hinge vertically.
Wagon liftgates have additional adjusters on the sides. Loosen their screws a few turns and close the liftgate. The adjuster should seek the correct
position for smooth operation. Because of the curve of the body and roofline, the wagon liftgate needs to be checked carefully for alignment to the body.
Seams should be straight and even, and panels should be flush with no obvious high or low points.
Final adjustments are made at the latch (on the lid) and the striker (on the body). Each can be loosened and moved on its mounts to control tightness and
ease of operation. It is recommended to start by loosening the striker only; close the lid or liftgate and let the striker seek its position. Continue adjusting
until the latch has no binding in its operation, the key turns freely and the weatherstrip is evenly compressed around the lid/liftgate.
