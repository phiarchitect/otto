Seat Heater Control Module: Testing and Inspection
Leather or plush trim
If a fault is suspected, e.g. short circuit in the heater element, bear in mind that:
- Heating will not switch on if the in-car temperature is above +18 °C (64 °F). Full heat output
triggers on within 3 - 6 seconds after start of function check.
- When in-car temperature is between 10 - 18 °C (50 - 64 °F) the heater goes directly to low output.
Full output only triggers on when temperature is below 10 °C (50 °F).
- The control module has two modes for either plush or leather trim, so that trim will not affect
heating.
If the above conditions are not fulfilled, but both supply and ground are OK, the module should be
replaced.
If supply is missing, check seat heating switch.

This Service Bulletin replaces earlier Service Bulletin 87-955 from September 1996, which should
be discarded.
Odor from evaporator, installation of blower fan control module
Under humid conditions the ECC unit can cause an unpleasant odor on start-up, especially when
the temperature outside is high. This Odor often disappears when humidity levels drops. The Odor
can be caused by dirt or micro-organisms in the evaporator.

A control module can be installed to eliminate the recurrence of the Odor. This starts the blower fan
and airs residual dampness out of the evaporator.
If the compressor has been running more than 4 minutes and the ignition is then turned off for 50
minutes, the control module starts the blower fan automatically and runs an airing out cycle at max.
Blower speed for approximately 5 minutes.
Special tools needed: Wiring repair kit, P/N 9814235-9

After installing the airing cycle unit, copy and attach the last page.

Electronic Brake Control Module: Reading and Clearing Diagnostic Trouble Codes

Chassis Number Table
In older models (1992-93), with chassis numbers as shown in the table, a control module with
built-in diagnostic function can be used as a 'special tool' for reading off DTCs via the DLC. The
control module part numbers are 913 0197-8 or 912 8853-0.
- Replace the existing control module with the unit with the built-in diagnostic function.
- Drive the car at over 4 miles/h (6 km/h). The control module will record any faults and post DTCs.
These can then be read out via the DLC in DTM 1.
With pre-92 models (1989-91), the new control module cannot be used for fault-tracing or
diagnosis, as the DLC is not wired up.
Diagnostic system
The control module has a self-test function in DTMs 1 and 4. This is connected to DLC A position
3. If the control module detects a fault, it switches the ABS warning light on and posts the DTC.
DTCs can be read out via the DLC during fault-tracing. If any fault occurs, apart from a fault with
the brake light workings, the control module disables the ABS system completely. To restore the
ABS system once a temporary (intermittent) fault is discovered, the ignition must be switched off
first. The diagnostic system monitors the wheel sensors, brake light contact, hydraulic valves, valve
relay, pump motor and pump motor relay. DTMs In DTM 1, the diagnostic system can identify 14
different types of fault. Faults are displayed as flashing codes. Up to three DTCs can be stored
simultaneously. DTM 4 is used to alter the code transmission rate. Once the diagnostic system is
activated, the ABS system cuts out and the ABS warning light comes on to indicate that you need
to exit from the diagnostic system before driving the car. To exit from a DTM and turn the ABS
warning light off once a fault has been erased, you must switch the ignition off first. Diagnosis in
older models Older models (1992-1993) with chassis numbers as shown in special notes for
reading DTC's, can use a control module and diagnostic system as a 'special tool' to read off DTCs
via the DLC. Models before 1992 (1989-1991), cannot use the new control module for fault-tracing
and diagnosis, as there is no wire between the control module and the DLC.
For testing refer to "OBD with control module 913 0197-8 or 912 8853-0 (only)". See: Brakes and

* Power is furnished either through the ignition switch Pin 15 directly or through an over voltage
protection relay. If a relay is used in the system then Pin 15 will supply the energizing signal to the
relay and the relay contacts closing provides the supply voltage to Pin 1 of the ECU. Usually the
over voltage protection relay is mounted close to the ECU.

Electronic Brake Control Module: Description and Operation General
DESCRIPTION
The control module (3A/3B) measures and controls the speed of the wheels during braking in
response to signals from the wheel sensors (1, 2). This is designed to prevent the wheels locking.
OPERATION
Input signals come from inductive sensors which detect the speed of the wheels. The output
signals from the control module control the three solenoid hydraulic valves and the pump motor.
During braking, the control module processes the sensor signals, calculates the speed of the
wheels, retardation, road speed and wheel slip. If any of the wheels threatens to lock during
braking, the control module sends a command to the valves in the hydraulic modulator which
immediately adjust the pressure in the brake circuit to that wheel (or both rear wheels) to maintain
maximum braking power while giving the driver maximum control of the car. Increasing or
decreasing the brake pressure keeps the wheels just short of locking point to give the tires the
maximum grip on the road. This working cycle is continuous and repeated many times a second.
The control module is connected to the rest of the system via a 35-pin connector. When the ignition
is switched on, the control module switches the ABS warning light (6) on and makes an initial check
to see that there are no internal faults in the system and that the signals from the sensors are
correct. At the same time, it triggers the valve relay (8) to provide power to the hydraulic modulator
valves. If no faults are found, the warning light goes out about 2 seconds after starting the engine.
When the car moves off and reaches a speed of over 6 km/h for the first time, the control module
makes a brief check (approx. 20 milliseconds) to see that the hydraulic pump is working by
triggering the pump relay (10) and starting the pump. The control module then checks the valves by
activating each one in turn. As well as this initial check, the control module makes constant checks

to see that all input and output signals and components are working properly and that there are no
internal faults in the control module itself. If it finds a fault, it switches the ABS warning light on and
disables the ABS system. The system then works like any conventional braking system. The
control module stores details of faults in the form of DTCs.

When fault tracing, also see wiring diagram.
OBD ON OLDER MODELS
The new control module can be used to fault trace ABS on vehicles from 1992 up to the chassis
numbers given at the beginning of this bulletin, to read off DTCs via the diagnostic unit.
Replace the existing control module with a new control module with an OBD function. Drive the car.
Speed must exceed 4 mph (6 km/h). Faults will be posted by the control module which stores
DTCs. These can then be read off via the diagnostic unit and test function 1. See DTC table above.
On M/Y '89-'91 fault tracing and diagnosis cannot be carried out using the new control module, as
there is no diagnostic lead to the diagnostic unit.
Change location of sensor lead, M/Y '93 (Jan. - March) 940 with Rex/Regina ignition and fuel
system
On cars with the Rex/Regina ignition/fuel system and an ABS control module, p/n 9130197-8, with
OBD system, interference can occur in the sensor lead to the left front wheel. Interference can
cause symptoms such as pulsing in the brake pedal when the car is stationary and the engine RPM
is above idle. Normal braking function is not affected. If symptoms occur, modify sensor lead as per
figure (see new position of sensor lead).
The routing of the sensor lead was changed from the hole in the wheel housing to the connector in
the engine compartment. The lead was moved forward and pulled down towards the wheel housing
plate. (See illustration). This measure was introduced into production from chassis number:

This Service Bulletin replaces earlier Service Bulletin 87-955 from September 1996, which should
be discarded.
Odor from evaporator, installation of blower fan control module
Under humid conditions the ECC unit can cause an unpleasant odor on start-up, especially when
the temperature outside is high. This Odor often disappears when humidity levels drops. The Odor
can be caused by dirt or micro-organisms in the evaporator.

A control module can be installed to eliminate the recurrence of the Odor. This starts the blower fan
and airs residual dampness out of the evaporator.
If the compressor has been running more than 4 minutes and the ignition is then turned off for 50
minutes, the control module starts the blower fan automatically and runs an airing out cycle at max.
Blower speed for approximately 5 minutes.

Electronic Brake Control Module: Description and Operation Special Notes For Reading DTC's
Chassis Number Table
In older models (1992-93), with chassis numbers as shown in the table, a control module with
built-in diagnostic function can be used as a 'special tool' for reading off DTCs via the DLC. The
control module part numbers are 913 0197-8 or 912 8853-0.
- Replace the existing control module with the unit with the built-in diagnostic function.
- Drive the car at over 4 miles/h (6 km/h). The control module will record any faults and post DTCs.
These can then be read out via the DLC in DTM 1.
With pre-92 models (1989-91), the new control module cannot be used for fault-tracing or
diagnosis, as the DLC is not wired up.

ABS braking system and on-board diagnostic (OBD) system
Replaced ABS control module, with an integral OBD function, p/n 9130197-8, was introduced into
production from the illustrated chassis numbers.
From production month 4/93 the control module has a new p/n, 9128853-0. This control module is
a replacement part and replaces older control modules on models from 1989 on.

The new control module OBD function is connected to position 3, diagnostic unit A in the engine
compartment. When the control module discovers a fault, the ABS indicator lamp lights at the same
time as it stores a DTC. During fault tracing/diagnosis the DTC can be read with the VST or by
using the LED on the diagnostic unit by activating test function 1. See DTC table.

Compressor Clutch Relay: Description and Operation

Used by fuel injection ECU.
The A/C cut-off relay (located in front of the driver side strut tower) receives a signal from the
throttle position sensor, when the throttle valve is in the full load position. The relay will then open
and interrupt the A/C compressor operation. The A/C compressor will resume operation as soon as
the throttle position sensor is no longer in the full load position. The fuel injection ECU monitors the
A/C system via a connection to the A/C cut-off relay.

Page 107

** If there are only three valves listed it means there isn't a right rear valve and therefore no wire in
Pin 19. If a wire exists in Pin 19 it will mean the system has four solenoid valves.
*** Not all Bosch ABS 2 have a Solenoid valve on the right rear wheel. This does not mean that if a
system has only three solenoid valves that it will only have three wheel speed sensors. These
differences are sorted out in the chart.
**** Not all Bosch ABS 2 have a wheel speed sensor on the right rear wheel. Systems that have
only three wheel speed sensors have the rear sensor mounted in the differential housing. The
easiest way to determine how the wheel speed sensors are wired is to inspect the 35 Pin plug and
see what contacts are used for in system being tested.
