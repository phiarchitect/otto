pg. 1:11 Heating and air conditioning

Heating and air conditioning
Your Volvo is equipped with a heating system combined with air conditioning.
Depending on which function you select, warm or cool/cold air is distributed to the different parts of the
passenger compartment.
The air conditioning system in your car contains a CFC-refrigerant - R134a. This is an environmentally
friendly substance having minimal effect on the earth's ozone layer.
The system contains 2.1 lbs (0.95 kg) R134a.

Operating tips
The air conditioning system functions only at temperatures above 45°F (7°C).
The air conditioning will only function if the blower is set to position 1 or higher.

Choose this position if the outside air is contaminated with exhaust gases, smoke, etc or to heat/
cool the car quickly. In this position, very little air is drawn into the passenger compartment from the
outside. Do not leave the system in this mode for more than 10-15 minutes since the air inside the car
will become stale. The temperature can be controlled with the temperature dial.
Remember: If the panel vents are open, a certain amount of air will always flow through, regardless of
the position the function dial is in. To increase the flow of air to either the floor or the windows, close
the panel vents. The outer vents can be opened to avoid mist on the side windows.
The air conditioning system will function best if it is used regularly.
Water under the vehicle in hot weather can be the result of condensation from the air conditioning
system.

pg. 1:41 General information

Sending signals
The FM waves do not follow the earth's surface nor do they bounce off the atmosphere. for this reason
their range is limited.
The AM waves follow the earth's surface and reflect against the atmosphere, giving them a wide range.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_1_39.html (4 of 9)12/30/2006 9:44:22 AM

1993 Volvo 940

Weak reception (fading)
Because of the limited range of the FM senders and the fact that these waves are very reflective, this
problem usually occurs with FM reception. If the sender is blocked by buildings or mountains, static can
result.

Static
The reason why FM but not AM is audible is covered parking areas, under bridges, etc., is that FM
signals reflect against solid objects such as buildings. Because these waves are very reflective, static can
result. This static is the result of the reflected signal and the direct signal reaching your antenna at
slightly different times causing a cancellation of all signals. This problem occurs largely in built-up
areas.

Cross modulation
If you listen to a weak station in the vicinity of a stronger one, both stations may be received
simultaneously.

FM - reasons for distortion
FM is affected by the electrical systems of nearby vehicles, especially those without suppression. The
distortion increases if the station is weak or poorly set.
The FM reception is not as sensitive to electrical disturbances as AM.

AM - reasons for distortion
AM reception is sensitive to electrical disturbances such as power lines, lighting, etc.
pg. 1:43 Radio
FM stereo reception
Stereo reception places very high demands on the signal quality which means the type of distortions
previously mentioned become even more obvious. The signal strength needs to be stronger for good
stereo reception and this limits the effective range of the sender.
We hope that this information proves to be useful and provides you with a better understanding of the
problems related to car radio reception.
Reception conditions are not always optimum and this is, of course, beyond our control. However, we
have endeavored to make the Volvo Audio System of a quality that will enable you to enjoy the best
possible reception no matter what the reception conditions may be.
Radio antenna

NOTE: Always lower the antenna (by switching off the radio) when using an automatic car wash or
entering a garage. The antenna should be cleaned at least every 10,000 miles (16,000 km) or more
frequently if needed. Use WD40 for cleaning.

NOTE: The cruise control cannot be engaged at speeds below 22 mph (35
km).
Operating brake pedal
This will automatically disengage the cruise control. Previously selected cruise control speed is retained
in the memory and by momentarily setting the switch to RESUME position, that speed will be reengaged.
Acceleration
If the cruise control is already engaged, the cruising speed can be increased or decreased by depressing
the SET SPEED button (2). The vehicle will then maintain the current speed.
Depressing the SET SPEED button briefly will result in a 1 mph (1.6 km/h) increase in the set speed.

NOTE:
When driving on a grade, actual vehicle speed may vary slightly from the set cruise control speed.
If actual speed falls below 70% of set speed or if the wheels spin, the cruise control will disengage
automatically.
Momentary acceleration, such as for passing, does not interrupt cruise control operation. The previously
selected speed will be maintained without having to set switch to RESUME.
To disengage the cruise control system : set switch (1) to position OFF, or depress the brake pedal.
Switching off the starting (ignition) switch or moving the gear selector to position N will automatically
disengage the cruise control system.

WARNING! The cruise control should not be used in heavy traffic or when driving on wet or slippery
roads. Do not use or resume cruise control in reverse gear.

3:10 Reporting Safety Defects
Despite our strongest recommendations, and your best intentions, not wearing a seat belt is like
believing "It'll never happen to me!". Volvo urges you and all adult occupants of your car to wear seat
belts and ensure that children are properly restrained, using an infant, car or booster seat determined by
age, weight and height.
Fact: In every state and province, some type of child-restraint legislation has been passed. Additionally,
most states and provinces have already made it mandatory for occupants of a car to use seat belts.
So, urging you to "buckle up" is not just our recommendation - legislation in your state or province may
mandate seat belt usage. The few seconds it takes to buckle up may one day allow you to say, "It's a
good thing I was wearing my seat belt".
pg. 3:2 Seat belts

Seat belts
Always fasten the seat belts before you drive or ride.
Two lights above the rear view mirror will be illuminated for 4-8 seconds after the starting (ignition) key
is turned to the driving position. One light is located in the instrument panel and one in the console
between the front seats.
A chime will sound at the same time if the driver has not fastened his seat belt. The rear seats are
provided with self-retracting inertia reel belts. The front seats are provided with single roller belts with
tensioners.
To buckle:
Pull the belt out far enough to insert the latch plate into the receptacle (buckle for rear seats) until a
file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_3_1.html (1 of 8)12/30/2006 9:44:26 AM

distinct snapping sound is heard. The seat belt retractor is normally "unlocked" and you can move freely,
provided that the shoulder belt is not pulled out too far. The retractor will lock up as follows:
●
●
●
●

if the belt is pulled out rapidly
during braking and acceleration
if the vehicle is leaning excessively
when driving in turns

In order for the seat belt to provide maximum protection in the event of an accident, it must be worn
correctly. When wearing remember:
● The belt should not be twisted or turned.
● The lap belt must be positioned low on the hips (not pressing against the abdomen). Make sure that
the shoulder belt is rolled up into its retractor and that the shoulder and lap belts are taut.

1993 Volvo 940

Before exiting the car, check that the seat belt retracts fully after being unbuckled. If necessary, guide
the belt back into the retractor slot.

WARNING! Any device used to induce slack into the shoulder belt portion of the three-point belt
system will have a detrimental effect on the amount of protection available to you in the event of a
collision.
The seat back should not be tilted too far back. The shoulder belt must be taut in order to function
properly.

Rear head restraint
The center head restraint can be adjusted according to the passenger's height. The restraints should be
carefully adjusted to support the occupant's head.

During pregnancy
Pregnant women should always wear seat belts. Remember that the belt should always be positioned in
such a way as to avoid any possible pressure on the abdomen. The lap portion of the belt should be
located low, as shown in the above illustration.

1993 Volvo 940

WARNING! Never use a seat belt for more than one occupant. Never wear the shoulder portion of the
belt under the arm, behind the back or otherwise out of position. Such use could cause injury in event
of accident. As the seat belts lose much of their strength when exposed to violent stretching, they
should be replaced after any collision, even though they may appear to be undamaged. Never repair
the belt on your own; have this done by an authorized Volvo dealer only.
pg. 3:4 Volvo SRS

As an enhancement to the three-point seat belt system, your Volvo is equipped with a Supplemental
Restraint System (SRS). The Volvo SRS consists of a driver's side airbag with a driver's side knee bolster
(5) and seat belt tensioners in both front door pillars (4). The system is designed to supplement the
protection provided by the three-point seat belt system.
The interior of an SRS-equipped Volvo looks very much the same as any other. The only indications of
the system's presence are the "SRS" embossed on the steering wheel pad, and the knee bolster beneath
the steering column.
The airbag is forlded and located in the center of the steering wheel. It is released only during certain
frontal or front-angular collisions, depending upon the crash severity, angle, speed and object impacted.

WARNING!
As its name implies, SRS is designed to be a SUPPLEMENT to - not a replacement for - the threepoint belt system. The airbag is designed not to be released in the event of a side or rear-end collision,
or during a rollover situation.for maximum protection, wear seat belts at all times. Be aware that no
system can prevent all possible injuries that may occur in an accident.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_3_1.html (5 of 8)12/30/2006 9:44:26 AM

1993 Volvo 940

The airbag system includes a gas generator (1) surrounded by the airbag itself (2) and two front seat belt
tensioners (4). To deploy the system, the sensor (3) activates the gas generators causing the airbags to be
inflated with nitrogen gas. As the movement of the seat's occupants compresses the airbags, some of the
gas is expelled at a controlled rate to provide better cushioning. Both seat belt tensioners also deploy,
minimizing any seat belt slack.
The entire process, including inflation and deflation of the airbags, takes approximately two-tenths of a
second.

WARNING!
When installing any optional equipment make sure that the SRS system is not damaged. Do not
attempt to service any component of the SRS yourself. Attempting to do so may result in serious
personal injury. If a problem arises, take your car to the nearest authorized Volvo Dealer for inspection
as soon as possible.
pg. 3:5 Volvo SRS

A self-diagnostic system incorporated in the sensor monitors the SRS. If a fault is detected, the "SRS"

warning light will illuminate. The light is included in the warning/indicator light cluster in the
instrument panel. Normally, the SRS warning lamp should light up when the ignition is switched on and
should go out after 10 seconds or when the engine is started. Check that this light is functioning properly
every time the car is started. Check that this light is functioning properly every time the car is started.
The following items are monitored by all the self-diagnostic system:
● Sensor unit
● Cable harness
● Gas generator ignitor

WARNING! Never drive an SRS equipped car with your hands on the steering wheel pad/airbag
housing.
WARNING! If the SRS warning light stays on after the engine has started or if it comes on while you
are driving, drive the car to the nearest authorized Volvo dealer for inspection as soon as possible.

There is no maintenance to perform on the SRS yourself. The only periodic maintenance recommended
on the SRS is that the air bag modules and front seat belts (including tensioners) should be replaced
approximately every ten years and that the other components in the system (wiring, connectors, etc.)
should also be inspected at this time. The SRS decal on your car shows the month and year servicing is
due. This service must be performed by an authorized Volvo dealer.
Should you have any questions about the SRS system, please contact your authorized Volvo Dealer or

pg. 3:6 Volvo SRS
General SRS information
In a collision where deployment occurs, the air bag and seat belt tensioners activate. Some noise occurs
and a small amount of powder is released. This powder is not harmful and does no indicate fire.

NOTE: Deployment of SRS components occurs only one time during an
accident.
If you are involved in an accident which has resulted in air bag deployment, we recommend the
following:
- Have the car towed to an authorized Volvo dealer or collision repair shop. Even if the car is driveable
after an accident, we do NOT recommend driving the car with a deployed air bag.
- Have the SRS replacement performed by an authorized Volvo dealer OR ask the body shop performing
the collision repairs to have the SRS replacement done at a Volvo dealer.
- Have all deployed/damaged SRS components (air bag and front seat belt assemblies) replaced with

Child Restraint Anchorages
Volvo cars are fitted with Child Restraint Top Tether Anchorages in the rear seat. There are three
anchorages under the rear section of the car's rear window shelf on sedans and on the back rest on
wagons. The backrest on wagons must be forlded down slightly to reach the anchorages. When the car is
delivered, the holes for these anchorages are covered by plastic covers. In cars designated for Canada,
one top tether anchorage set will be in the glove box.
The top tether anchorage set includes the top tether anchorage plate, an 5/16" UNC bolt and a plastic
trim cover. If another set is needed, consult your Volvo dealer.
Installing the top tether
Remove the plastic cover on the anchorage point you want to use. This can be done with a suitable coin.
The cover is removed counter-clockwise. Refer to the child seat manufacturer's instructions for securing
the seat. An additional bolt may be required for sedans. This may be obtained from your authorized
Volvo dealer.

WARNING! Child Restraint Anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by
correctly fitted Child Restraints. Under no circumstances are they to be used for adult seat belts or
harnesses.
The anchorages are not able to withstand excessive forces on them in the event of collision if full
harness seat belts or adult seat belts are installed to them. An adult who uses a belt anchored in a Child
Restraint Anchorage runs a great risk of suffering severe injuries should a collision occur. Do not
install rear speakers which would require the removal of the top tether anchors or interfere with the
proper use of the top tether strap.

Integrated booster cushion (certain models)
Volvo's own integrated booster cushion has been specially designed to help safeguard a child seated in
the center position of the rear seat. In combination with the standard three-point seat belt, it is approved
for children weighing between 22.7 and 36 kg (50 and 80 lbs) and between 117 and 137 cm (46 and 54
in ) in height. Press button A to forld up the booster cushion when it is not in use.
Sedan

With the child seated on the cushion, the hip section of the three-point belt must pass through seat belt
guide B.
Wagon

The hip section of the three-point seat belt must fit snugly across the child's hips, not across the stomach.

WARNING!
In the event of a collision while the integrated booster cushion was occupied, the entire booster
cushion and center seat belt must be replaced. The booster cushion should also be replaced if it is
badly worn or damaged in any way. This work should be performed by an authorized Volvo dealer
only. The booster cushion should be cleaned while in place if the vehicle if possible. If not, please
consult your Volvo dealer.

pg. 3:9 Child safety (cont.)
Child safety
Volvo recommends the proper use of restraint systems for all occupants including children. Remember
that, regardless of age and size, a child should always be properly restrained in a car.
Restraint systems for children are designed to be secured in the vehicle by lap belts or the lap portion of
a lap-shoulder belt. Such child restraint systems can help protect children in cars in the event of an
accident only if they are used properly. However, children could be endangered in a crash if the child
restraints are not properly secured in the vehicle. Failure to follow the installation instructions for your
child restraint can result in your child striking the vehicle's interior in a sudden stop.
Holding a child in your arms is NOT a suitable substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, a
child held in a person's arms can be crushed between the vehicle's interior and an unrestrained person.
The child could also be injured by striking the interior, or by being ejected from the vehicle during a
sudden maneuver or impact. The same can also happen if the infant or child rides unrestrained on the
seat. Other occupants should also be properly restrained to help reduce the chance of injuries or
increasing the injury of a child.
All states and provinces have legislation governing how and where children should be carried in car.
Find out the regulations existing in your state or province. Recent accident statistics have shown that
children are safer in rear seating positions than front seating positions when properly restrained. A child
restraint system can help protect a child in a vehicle. Here's what to look for when selecting a child
restraint system:
It should have a label certifying that it meets applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
(FMVSS 213-80) - or in Canada, CMVSS 213.
● Make sure the child restraint system is approved for the child's height, weight and development - the
label required by the standard or regulation, or instructions for infant restraints, typically provide this
information.
● In using any child restraint system, we urge you to look carefully over the instructions that are
provided with the restraint. Be sure you understand them and can use the device properly and safely in
this vehicle. A misused child restraint system can result in increased injuries for both the infant or child
and other occupants in the vehicle.
● If your child restraint requires a top tether strap, consult your authorized Volvo dealer for top tether
anchorage and installation information.
●

When a child has outgrown the child safety seat, you should use the rear seat with the standard seat belt
fastened. The best way to help protect the child here is to place the child on a cushion so that the seat
belt is properly located on the hips.
A specially designed and tested booster cushion for children between 22.7 - 36 kg (50 - 80 lbs) and 117 137 cm (46 - 54") can be obtained from your Volvo dealer.
If necessary, an auxiliary seat for children is available for use in the luggage compartment of station

wagon models. This seat is designed for two children, each up to 88 lbs. and up to 59 inches in height.
pg. 3:10 Occupant safety
Seat belt maintenance
Check periodically that the anchor bolts are secure and that the belts are in good condition.
Use water and a mild detergent for cleaning.
Check seat belt mechanism function as follows:
Attach the seat belt and pull rapidly on the strap.

WARNING! Check other traffic before performing the following
check.
Brake firmly from approximately 30 mph (50 km/h) or turn in a tight circle while pulling on the belt.
In the above checks you should not be able to pull the belt out.
Volvo Concern for Safety
Safety is the cornerstone for Volvo. Our concern dates back to 1927 when the first Volvo rolled off the
production line. Three-point seat belts, safety cages, and energy-absorbing impact zones were designed
into Volvo cars long before it was fashionable or required by government regulation. We will not
compromise our commitment to safety. We continue to seek out new safety features and to refine those
already in our cars. You can help. We would appreciate hearing your suggestions about improving
automobile safety. We also want to know if you ever have a safety concern with your car.
Occupant safety
How safely you drive doesn't depend on how old you are but rather on:
● how well you see
● your ability to concentrate
● how quickly you make decisions under stress to avoid an accident.
The tips listed below are suggestions to help you cope with the ever changing traffic environment.
● Never drink and drive.
● If you are taking any medication, consult your physician about its potential effects on your driving
abilities.
● Take a driver-retraining course
● Have your eyes checked regularly
● Keep your windshield and headlamps clean.
● Replace wiper blades when they start to leave streaks.

Take into account the traffic, road, and water conditions, particularly with regard to stopping distance.

Reporting Safety Defects in the U.S.
If you believe that your vehicle has a defect which could cause a crash or could cause injury or death,
you should immediately inform the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in
addition to notifying Volvo Cars of North America. If NHTSA receives similar complaints, it may open
an investigation, and if it finds that a safety defect exists in a group of vehicles, it may order a recall and
remedy campaign. However, NHTSA cannot become involved in individual problems between you,
your retailer, or Volvo Cars of North America. To contact NHTSA, you may either call the Auto Safety
Hotline toll-free at 1-800-424-9393 (or 366-0123 in Washington, D.C. area) or write to: NHSTA, U.S.
Department of Transportation, Washington D.C. 20590. You can also obtain other information about
motor vehicle safety from the Hotline.

Unleaded Fuel
Each Volvo has a three-way catalytic converter and must use only unleaded gasoline. U.S. and Canadian
file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_4_1.html (1 of 5)12/30/2006 9:44:28 AM

1993 Volvo 940

regulations require that pumps delivering unleaded gasoline be labeled "UNLEADED". Only these
pumps have nozzles which fit your car's filler inlet. It is unlawful to dispense leaded fuel into a vehicle
labeled "unleaded gasoline only". Leaded gasoline damages the three-way catalytic converter and the
heated oxygen sensor system. Repeated use of leaded gasoline will lessen the effectiveness of the
emission control system and could result in loss of emission warranty coverage. State and local vehicle
inspection programs will make detection of misfueling easier, possibly resulting in emission test failure
for misfueled vehicles.
Octane Rating
Volvo engines are designed for optimum performance on unleaded premium gasoline with an octane
rating, AKI of 91, or above. AKI (ANTI KNOCK INDEX) is an average of the Research Octane
Number, RON, and the Motor Octane Number, MON, (RON + MON/ 2). The minimum octane
requirement is AKI 87 (RON 91).
Gasoline Containing Alcohol and Ethers
"Oxygenated fuels"
Some fuel suppliers sell gasoline containing "oxygenates" which are usually alcohols or ethers. In some
areas, state or local laws require that the service pump be marked indicating use of alcohol or ethers.
However, there are areas in which the pumps are unmarked. If you are not sure whether there is alcohol
or ethers in the gasoline you buy, check with the service station operator. To meet seasonal air quality
restrictions, some states require the use of "oxygenated" fuel in certain areas.
Volvo allows the use of the following "oxygenated fuels"; however, the octane ratings listed on this page
must still be met.
Alcohol -- Ethanol
Fuels containing up to 10% ethanol by volume may be used.
Ethanol may also be referred to as Ethyl alcohol, or "Gasohol".
Ethers -- MTBE
Fuels containing up to 15% MTBE may be used.
Refueling
The fuel tank filler cap is located behind the door on the left rear fender. Open cap slowly during hot
weather conditions.
When filling, position the cap in the special bracket on the door.
After filling the tank, install the cap and turn until a "click" is heard.
The fuel tank is designed to hold approximately 19.8 US gals (75 liters) with sufficient volume left over
to accommodate possible expansion of the fuel in hot weather. Be aware that the "usable" tank capacity
will be somewhat less than the 19.8 US gallons (75 liters) maximum. When the fuel level is low, such
factors as ambient temperature, the fuel's "vapor pressure" characteristics, and terrain can affect the fuel
file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_4_1.html (2 of 5)12/30/2006 9:44:28 AM

1993 Volvo 940

pumps' ability to supply the engine with an adequate supply of fuel. Therefore, it is advisable to refuel as
soon as possible when the needle nears the red zone, or when the fuel warning light comes on.

CAUTION: Take care not to spill gasoline during refueling.
Gasolines containing alcohol can cause damage to painted surfaces, which may not be covered under
the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.
Do not use gasoline containing methanol (methyl alcohol, wood alcohol). This practice can result in
vehicle performance deterioration and can damage critical parts in the fuel system.
Such damage may not be covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.
pg. 4:3 Driving economy, Carbon deposits
Economical driving does not necessarily mean driving slowly
Better driving economy may be obtained by thinking ahead, avoiding rapid starts and stops and
adjusting the speed of your vehicle to immediate traffic conditions. Observe the following rules:
Bring the engine to normal operating temperature as soon as possible by driving with a light forot on
the accelerator pedal for the first minutes of operation. A cold engine uses more fuel and is subject to
increased wear.
● Whenever possible, avoid using the car for driving short distances. This does not allow the engine to
reach normal operating temperature.
● Drive carefully and avoid rapid acceleration and hard braking.
● Do not exceed speed limit.
● Avoid carrying unnecessary items (extra load) in the car.
● Check tire pressure regularly (check when tires are cold).
● Remove snow tires when threat of snow or ice has ended.
● Note that roof racks, ski racks, etc., increase air resistance and thereby fuel consumption.
● Turbo: try to keep the boost pressure gauge in the black range.
● Utilize overdrive at speeds above approx. 45 mph (70 km/h)
● Avoid using automatic transmission kick-down feature unless necessary.
●

Other factors which decrease gas mileage are:
● Worn or dirty spark plugs
● Incorrect spark plug gap
● Dirty air cleaner
● Incorrect valve clearance
● Dirty engine oil and clogged oil filter
● Dragging brakes
● Incorrect front end alignment
● Low tire pressure

Some of the above mentioned items and others are checked at the standard Maintenance Service
intervals.
Deposit control gasoline
Volvo recommends the use of gasoline containing deposit control additives. These additives have shown
to be efficient in keeping injectors and intake valves clean. Consistent use of deposit control gasolines
will help ensure good driveability and fuel economy. If you are not sure whether the gasoline contains
deposit control additives, check with the service station operator.

Note:
Do not add additives yourself to the gasoline, unless you are recommended to do so by an authorized
Volvo dealer.
pg. 4:4 Starting the engine, Turbo caution
Starting and stopping a car equipped with automatic transmission
1 Fasten the seat belt.

WARNING! Before starting, check that the seat is adjusted properly. Make sure the brake pedal can be
depressed completely. Move the seat closer if necessary. Refer to section "Front seats".
2 Apply the parking brake, if not already set. The gear selector is locked in the (P)ark position
( SHIFTLOCK ).
3 Without touching the accelerator pedal , turn the ignition key to the starting position. Allow the starter
to operate for 5-10 seconds. Release the key as soon as the engine starts. If the engine fails to start,
repeat step 3.
Turbo only : for cold starts at altitudes above 6000 ft (1800 m), depress the accelerator pedal halfway
and turn the key to the starting position. Release the accelerator pedal slowly when the engine starts.
4 To release the gear selector, depress the brake pedal . See page 6:18 for instructions on manually
overriding the SHIFTLOCK system if the lever cannot be moved. Do not race a cold engine
immediately after starting. Oil flow may not reach some lubricating points fast enough to prevent engine
damage.
5 Select desired gear. The gear engages after a slight delay, especially noticeable when selecting R.

1993 Volvo 940

CAUTION: Engine should be idling; never accelerate until after you feel the gear engage! Too rapid
acceleration immediately after selecting a gear will cause harsh engagement and premature
transmission wear.
6 Release the brakes and accelerate
To stop the car, release the accelerator pedal and apply the brakes.

NOTE: Your car is equipped with a KEYLOCK switch system. When the engine is switched off, the
gear selector must be in the (P)ark position before the key can be removed from the ignition switch.
WARNING!
Never leave car unattended with engine running.
Always open the garage doors fully before starting the engine inside a garage to ensure adequate
ventilation. The exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide, which is invisible and odorless but very
poisonous.
WARNING!
Always place gear selector securely in Park, and apply parking brake before leaving vehicle. Never
leave car unattended with engine running.
Turbo caution
Never race the engine immediately after starting . Oil flow may not reach some lubricating points fast
enough to prevent engine damage.
Do not race the engine just prior to switching off!

Precautionary steps to observe when car is in tow
Steering must be unlocked.
● Please check with state and local authorities before attempting this type of towing, as vehicles being
towed are subject to regulations regarding maximum towing speed, length and type of towing device,
lighting, etc.
● Remember that power brake and power steering assists will not be available when engine is
inoperative. Brake pedal pressure required is 3 - 4 times above normal and greater steering effort must
be exerted.
Automatic transmission
● Gear selector in position N. Check transmission oil level (see section titled "Transmission oil").
● Maximum speed: 20 mph (30 km/h).
● Maximum distance with rear wheels on ground: 20 miles (30 km).

WARNING!
Failure to follow the instructions for jump starting can lead to personal
injury.
pg. 4:15 Winter driving
Cold weather precautions
If you wish to check your car before the approach of cold weather, the following advice is worth
noting:
Make sure that the engine coolant contains at least 50 percent antifreeze: that is, 5.3 qts. (5 liters) Volvo
Genuine Coolant/Antifreeze. This gives protection against freezing down to -31°F (-35°C). See section
"Coolant".
The use of "recycled" antifreeze is not approved by Volvo.
Different types of antifreeze may not be mixed.
● Try to keep the fuel tank well filled - this prevents the formation of condensation in the tank.
In addition in extremely cold weather conditions it is worthwhile to add fuel line de-icer before
refueling.
● Use the correct grade of engine oil to avoid difficulties when starting. See section "Engine oil".
● The load placed on the battery is greater during the winter since the heater, windshield wipers,
lighting etc. are used more often. Moreover, the capacity of the battery decreases as the temperature
drops. In very cold weather, a poorly charged battery can freeze and be damaged. It is therefore
advisable to check the state of charge more frequently and spray an anti-rust oil on the battery posts.
● The viscosity of the engine oil is important. Oil with low viscosity (thinner oil) improves coldweather starting as well as decreasing fuel consumption while the engine is warming up. for winter use,
5W-30 oil, particularly the synthetic type, is recommended.
Be sure to use good quality oil but do not use this cold-weather oil for hard driving or in warm weather.
See section "Engine oil" for more information.
● Use lock spray or grease in the locks.
● To prevent the washer reservoir from freezing, add washer solvents containing antifreeze. This is
important since the dirt is often splashed on the windshield during winter driving, thus requiring
frequent use of the washers and wipers. The Volvo Washer Solvent should be diluted as follows:
Down to 14°F (-10°C): 1 part anti-freeze and 4 parts water
Down to 5°F (-15°C): 1 part anti-freeze and 3 parts water
Down to 0°F (-18°C): 1 part anti-freeze and 2 parts water
Down to -18°F (-28°): 1 part anti-freeze and 1 part water
●

NOTE: Avoid the use of de-icing spray as they can cause damage to the
locks.
Automatic differential lock

1993 Volvo 940

The differential automatically locks at speed between 3 - 25 mph (5 - 40 km/h) if either of the drive
wheels begins to lose traction. The differential lock improves power distribution to the drive wheels in
slippery conditions, shifting power to the wheel with best traction. It also functions when the
transmission is in reverse.
pg. 4:16 Towing a trailer
When preparing for trailer hauling, observe the following:
● Use a trailer hitch which meets Federal Safety Standards for rear end collisions (FMVSS 301-75) for
trailer weights exceeding 2000 lbs. (908 kg), use only a trailer hitch offered as a Genuine Volvo
Accessory. Since the automatic transmission is subject to increased load and temperature, certain
vehicles are equipped with an extra oil cooler as standard equipment. Consult your Volvo dealer for
additional information.
● Maximum trailer weight recommended by
Volvo is:
Trailers without brakes : 1540 lbs (700kg)
Trailers with brakes: 2" ball - 3300 lbs (1500 kg), 1 7/8" ball - 2000 lbs (908 kg).
Observe legal requirements of the state in which the vehicles are registered.
All Volvo models are equipped with energy-absorbing shock-mounted bumpers. Trailer hitch
installation should not interfere with the proper operation of this bumper system.

WARNING! Never connect a trailer's hydraulic brake system directly to the vehicle brake system, nor
a trailer's lighting system directly to the vehicle lighting system. Consult your nearest authorized
Volvo dealer for correct installation.
WARNING! Bumper-attached trailer hitches must not be used on Volvos, nor should safety chains be
attached to the bumper. Trailer hitches attaching to the vehicle rear axle must not be used.
Trailer towing does not normally present any particular problems, but take into consideration:
● Increase tire pressure to recommended full-load pressure. See section "Wheels and tires".
● Recommended hitch tongue load is 165 (75 kgs) for trailer weights above 2,650 lbs (1,200 kgs) and
110 lbs (50 kgs) for trailer weights below 2,650 lbs (1,200 kgs).
● for trailer weights between 2,650-3,300 lbs (1,200-1,500 kgs) a top speed of 50 mph (80 km/h) should
never be exceeded.
● Engine and transmission are subject to increased loads. Therefore, engine coolant temperature should
be closely watched when driving in hot climates or hilly terrain. Use lower gear and turn off air
conditioner if temperature gauge pointer enters the red range.
● Disengage the overdrive on models with automatic transmission
file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_4_12.html (5 of 9)12/30/2006 9:44:29 AM

1993 Volvo 940

Avoid overload and other abusive operation.
● Hauling a trailer affects handling, durability, and economy.
● It is necessary to balance trailer brakes with the towing vehicle brakes to provide a safe stop. Check
and observe State/Local regulations.
● More frequent vehicle maintenance is required.
● Remove the ball and drawbar assembly when the hitch is not being used.
● Volvo recommends the use of synthetic engine oil when towing a trailer over long distances or in
mountainous areas.
● The trailer hitch tongue load (110/165 lbs - 50/75 kg) is part of the vehicle's capacity weight. It may
be necessary to reduce the trunk/cargo area load when towing a trailer to ensure that the max.
permissible axle load or gross vehicle weight are not exceeded.
●

NOTE: Refer to section "Automatic transmission" for additional trailer hauling
tips.
pg. 4:17 Brake system

If one of the brake circuits should malfunction, the red warning light will come on. (see page 1:4)
The pedal stroke increases slightly, the pedal feels softer and extra pressure is required for normal
braking.
If the light comes on while driving or braking, stop immediately and check the brake fluid level in the
reservoir.

WARNING!
If the fluid level is below the MIN mark in either section of the reservoir: DO NOT DRIVE. Tow the
car to a Volvo dealer and have the brake system checked and any leakage repaired.
Moisture on brake discs and brake pads affects braking.
Driving in rain and slush or passing through an automatic car wash can cause water to collect on the
brake discs and pads. This will cause a delay in braking effect when the pedal is depressed. To avoid
such a delay when the brakes are needed, depress the pedal occasionally when driving through rain,
slush etc. This will remove the water from the brakes. Check that brake application feels normal. This
should also be done after washing or starting in very damp weather.
Severe strain on the brake system

1993 Volvo 940

The brakes will be subject to severe strain when driving in mountains or hilly areas. The speed is usually
low which means that the cooling of the brakes is less efficient than when driving on level roads.
To reduce the strain on the brakes it is advisable not to use the brakes excessively.
Instead, shift into a lower gear and let the engine help with the braking. A good rule is to use the same
gear downhill as would be used ascending the same grade. for vehicles with automatic transmission use
position 2 or, in some cases, 1.
Do not forget that, if you are towing a trailer, the brakes will be subjected to greater load than is normal.
Breaking-in parking brake (hand brake)
To obtain the best parking brake performance, the brake linings should be broken-in.
Stop 5-7 times from 30 mph (50 km/h). transmission in neutral, applying the parking brake with the
release button pressed in during the stop.
The force must not lock the rear wheels. If this happens, rotate the brake enough to let the wheels rotate.
Drive a mile between each stop to cool the brakes. Check for proper parking brake operation.
WARNING!
The brake lights are not illuminated when applying the parking brake. To warn traffic from behind it is
therefore advisable to depress the brake pedal slightly to illuminate the brake lights.
If the brake power-assist does not function
The power assist to the brakes functions only when the engine is running. When the car is moving
without the engine running the brake pedal pressure required to stop the car is increased by 3-4 times.
The brake pedal feels stiff and hard.
pg. 4:18 Long distance trip
Before a long distance trip
It is always worthwhile to have your car checked at a Volvo dealer before driving long distances. Your
dealer will also be able to supply you with bulbs, fuses, spark plugs and wiper blades for your use in the
event that problems occur.
If you prefer to check the car yourself, please note the following:
Check that the engine runs smoothly and that fuel consumption is normal.
● Check engine oil, coolant levels, and for possible fuel leakage.
● Check transmission oil level and rear axle for leakage.
● Check condition of drive belts.
● Check state of charge of battery.
● Examine tires carefully (the spare tire as well), and replace those that are worn. Check tire pressures.

1993 Volvo 940

The brakes, front wheel alignment, and steering gear should be checked by your Volvo dealer only.
● Check all lights, including high beams.
● Reflective warning triangles are legal requirement in some countries.
● Have a word with your Volvo dealer concerning engine adjustments if you intend to drive in countries
where it may be difficult to obtain correct fuel.
●

City driving
City driving can be a severe driving condition. Low operating speeds, long periods of idling combined
with high operating temperatures, air conditioning usage etc. will make necessary more frequent
servicing (at least every third month).
pg. 4:19 Vehicle storage
If you do not intend to use your car for a long time
The following points may be of use if you do not intend to use your car for a long time (e.g. because of a
long holiday, winter, etc.)
● Fill fuel tank to prevent water from condensing inside the tank.
● Wash the car carefully and wax it to protect the paint - don't forget the chromed parts.
● The vehicle should be left in a dry, well ventilated garage.
● Do not apply the hand brake. Block the wheels instead.
● Disconnect the battery's negative (-) cable.
● Lift the wiper arms away from the windshield.
● Increase tire pressure to maximum allowed, i.e. 36 psi.
● Open one of the window's slightly for ventilation.
● Ensure that the coolant contains sufficient anti-freeze to provide protection down to -22°F (-30°C).
Volvo Genuine Coolant/Anti-freeze also provides resistance against corrosion.
● Remove all valuables and lock the car.
Keep the battery fully charged.
pg. 4:20 ABS

Anti-lock Brake System - ABS
If the warning lamp lights up there is a malfunction of the ABS system (the standard braking system will
however function) and the vehicle should be driven to a Volvo dealer for inspection. The Anti-lock
Braking System (ABS) helps to improve vehicle control (stopping and steering) during severe braking
conditions by limiting brake lock-up. When the system "senses" impending lock-up, braking pressure is

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_4_12.html (8 of 9)12/30/2006 9:44:29 AM

1993 Volvo 940

automatically modulated in order to help prevent lockup, which could lead to a skid. The system
performs a self-diagnostic test when the vehicle is started and at 4 mph (6 km/h). The driver may detect
one pulsation of the brake pedal. This is normal.
To obtain optimal effect from the ABS system, constant pressure should be kept on the brake pedal
while the system is modulating the brakes.
The switching of the ABS modulator will be audible at this time.
Please be aware that ABS does not increase the absolute braking potential of the vehicle. While control
will be enhanced, ABS will not shorten stopping distances on slippery surfaces.

pg. 4:5 Automatic transmission
The following "Special Tips" apply to cars with automatic transmission
for steep hills and when driving for prolonged periods at low speed position 1should be selected.
Avoid, however, repeated changes since this can cause overheating of the transmission oil. for driving
on mountain roads with long persistent uphill gradients, select position 2.
● When negotiating long, steep downhill slopes, position 1 or 2 should be selected, in order to obtain
the best possible engine braking effect.
● Do not hold the car stationary on an incline by using the accelerator pedal; instead, engage the parking
brake. This prevents unnecessary heating of the transmission oil.
● When towing, prepare as follows:
Disengage the 4th gear (the indicator light on the instrument panel goes on).
●

Engine warm-up - initial driving procedure
Experience shoes that engines in vehicles driven short distances are subject to abnormally-rapid wear
because the engine never reaches normal operating temperature. It is therefore beneficial to reach normal
operating temperature as soon as possible. This is best achieved by driving with a light forot on the
accelerator pedal for a few minutes after starting, rather than prolonged idling.

1993 Volvo 940

P park
R reverse
N neutral
D drive
2 intermediate
1 low
P (Park)
Use this position when parked with the engine running or stopped
Never use P while car is in motion.
The transmission is mechanically locked when in position P. Also, apply the parking brake when
parking on grades.

WARNING!
Never leave the car when the engine is running. If, by mistake, the gear selector is moved from P, the
car may start moving.
The gear selector is locked in the P position - SHIFT-LOCK.
To release the selector, start the engine and depress the brake pedal. See section 6:18 for instructions
on manually releasing the gear selector.
R (Reverse)
Never engage R while is moving forward.
N (Neutral)
Neutral position = no gear is engaged. The engine can be started in this position. Use parking brake.
Driving gears
D (Drive)
D is the normal driving position. Upshifts and downshifts of the forward gears occur automatically and
are governed by accelerator pedal position and vehicle speed.
Lock-up

1993 Volvo 940

With the gear selector in position D (Drive) the lockup device disengages the torque converter at speeds
above approx. 47-56 mph (75-90 km/h). It provides lowered engine speeds and improved mileage.
The lockup engagement may be noticed as an extra upshift when accelerating.
pg. 4:7 Automatic transmission (cont.)
2 (intermediate position)
Upshifts and downshifts of first two gears (low and intermediate) occur automatically. No upshift to 3rd
or 4th gear occurs. Position 2 may be used to obtain forced downshift to 2nd gear for increased engine
braking effect.
1 (low position)
If position 1 is selected when driving at high speeds, 2 is engaged first and 1 when the speed has
dropped to approx. 30 mph (50 km/h). No upshift can occur once 1 is engaged. Use position 1 to select
low gear when no upshift is desired, for instance, when entering and descending steep grades.

Shift gate
The gear selector can be moved freely between D and 2. Selections of other positions are obtained by
depressing the selector knob prior to moving the selector.
Slightly depressing the selector knob allows selection of positions N, D, 2 and L. Fully depressing the
selector knob allows selection of positions R and P. This is also necessary when initially bringing the
selector out of position P.
Fully depressing the selector knob thus permits shifting freely between all positions.

pg. 4:8 Automatic transmission (cont.)

4th gear disengagement:
The 4th gear is engaged automatically after the transmission has shifted through 1st, 2nd and 3rd gears
at certain speeds and loads. By pressing in the button at the rear of the selector level, the 4th gear can be
disengaged, thus providing a three-speed transmission. As a reminder the é light on the dashboard
glows. By pressing in the button again, the transmission reverts to four-speed operation and the é
light shuts off.
Disengage the 4th gear when:
- towing a trailer
- driving in mountainous regions.
Since using the 4th gear improves fuel economy, it should be used as often as possible in conditions
other than those stated above.

WARNING!
● Never select P or R while the car is in motion.
● When initially selecting positions D, 3, 2, 1, or R, your forot should press firmly on the brake pedal
to ensure that the car is standing still with the engine idling.
● The gear selector should not be downshifted to 2 or 1 at speeds above 75 mph (125 km/h). *
* Always observe local speed limits.
Kick-down

1993 Volvo 940

Automatic shift to a lower gear (kick-down) is achieved by depressing the accelerator pedal fully and
briskly. An up-shift will be achieved when approaching the top speed for a particular gear or by
releasing the accelerator pedal slightly. Kick-down can be used for maximum acceleration or when
passing at highway speeds below a certain limit.

NOTE: The kickdown feature should not be used during the break-in
period.
pg. 4:9 Three-way catalytic converter
Three-way catalytic converter cautions

Keep your engine properly tuned. Certain engine malfunctions, particularly involving the electrical,
fuel or distributor ignition systems, may cause unusually high three-way catalytic converter
temperatures. Do not continue to operate your vehicle if you detect engine misfire, noticeable loss of
power or other unusual operating conditions, such as engine overheating or backfiring. A properly tuned
engine will help avoid malfunction that could damage the three-way catalytic converter.
● Remember that tampering or unauthorized modification to the engine or the vehicle may be illegal
and can cause three-way catalytic converter or exhaust system overheating. This includes:
- Altering fuel injection settings or components. Adjusting distributor ignition timing beyond specified
limits.
- Altering emission system components or location or removing components
- Repeated use of leaded fuel.
● Do not park your car over combustible materials, such as grass or leaves, which can come into contact
with the hot exhaust system and cause such materials to ignite under certain wind and weather
conditions.
●

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_4_5.html (5 of 9)12/30/2006 9:44:30 AM

1993 Volvo 940

Excessive starter cranking (in excess of one minute), with an intermittently firing or flooded engine,
can cause three-way catalytic converter or exhaust system overheating.

●

NOTE: Unleaded fuel is required for cars with three-way catalytic converters. A label on the
instrument panel and inside fuel tank filler door will remind owners and filling station attendants of
this requirement.
Important! It is unlawful to dispense leaded fuel into any vehicle labeled "unleaded gasoline only".
pg. 4:10 Points to remember
Weight distribution affects handling
At the specified curb weight your car has a tendency to understeer, which means that the steering wheel
has to be turned more than might seem appropriate for the curvature of a bend. This ensures good
stability and reduces the risk of rear wheel skid. Remember that these properties can alter with the
vehicle load. The heavier the load in the trunk, the less the tendency to understeer.
Handling, roadholding
Vehicle load, tire design, and inflation pressure, all affect vehicle handling. Therefore, check that the
tires are inflated to the recommended pressure according to the vehicle load. See "Tire pressure" section.
Loads should be distributed so that capacity weight or maximum permissible axle loads are not
exceeded.

WARNING! It is recommended that tire of the same make and dimensions be used on all four wheels
(including the use of snow tires). Do not use bias ply tires as this will adversely alter vehicle handling
characteristics.
WARNING!
An extra mat on the driver's floor can cause the accelerator pedal to catch. Check that the movement of
the accelerator pedal is not impeded. Not more than one protective floor covering may be used at one
time.
CAUTION: Driving through standing water
Drive slowly and carefully if going through standing water (i.e. flooded roadways, etc.). Damage to
engine could result if excess water is ingested through the air intake system.
Never drive the vehicle in water deeper than 1 forot (300 mm).

1993 Volvo 940

WARNING! Do not drive with trunk lid or tailgate open!
Poisonous exhaust gases may enter via the trunk lid or tailgate.
If the trunk lid/tailgate must be kept open for any reason, proceed as follows:
● Close the windows.
●

Set the ventilation system control to

and blower control to its highest

setting.
Roof racks (removable and permanent)
Roof rails are available as Volvo accessories. Observe the following points when is use:
● Avoid single-point loads. Distribute the load evenly.
● Place heavier cargo at bottom of load.
● Observe that center of gravity and handling are influenced by load weight.
● Increasing load size increases wind resistance and, thus, adversely affects fuel economy.
● Anchor the cargo correctly with a cord.
● Drive carefully. Avoid rapid starts, fast cornering and hard braking.
● Max. roof load is 220 lbs. (100 kg) for removable racks mounted on drip rails. for permanent roof
racks, check the manufacturers weight specifications.
● Max. roof load is 70 lbs (30 kg) for permanent rack mounted directly on roof.
Cooling system
The risk for overheating is greatest, especially in hot weather, when:
● towing a trailer up steep inclines for prolonged periods at wide open throttle and low engine rpm.
● idling for prolonged periods while the air conditioning is in operation. stopping the engine suddenly
after high speed driving (so-called "after-boiling" can occur).
pg. 4:11 Points to remember (cont.)
To avoid overheating, the following rules should be followed:
● Reduce speed and downshift when towing a trailer up long, steep inclines. The risk of overheating can
be reduced by switching off the air conditioning system for a short time.
● Do not let the engine idle unnecessarily for prolonged periods.
● Do not stop the engine immediately after high-speed driving, but instead, allow the engine to idle for
1/2-1 minute before switching off.
When the risk of overheating is imminent, or in the event of overheating, (the temperature gauge goes
repeatedly into, or stays continually in, the red section) the following precautions should be taken:
● Switch off the air conditioning system.
● Stop the car and put the gear lever into neutral (position N). Do not stop the engine!
● Increase the engine speed to approx. 2000 rpm (twice idling speed)
● If the vehicle is overheating, switch the heater to full (maximum) position.

●

Check the level of coolant in the expansion tank. Top-up, if necessary. See "Cooling System".

The engine must NOT be running when coolant is topped-up.
Electrical system
When replacing the battery or when carrying out work involving the electrical system, the following
should be observed:
● A battery connection to the wrong terminal will damage the diodes. Before connections are made,
check the polarity of the battery with a voltmeter.
● If booster batteries are used for starting, they must be properly connected to minimize the risk of the
diode being damaged. for correct connection, see "Jump starting" section.
● Never disconnect the battery circuit (for example, to replace the battery) while the engine is running,
as this will immediately ruin the generator. Always make sure that all the battery connections are
properly tightened.
● If any electrical/welding work is performed on the vehicle, the battery's ground lead (negative cable)
and all the connecting cables of the generator must be disconnected and the welder cables placed as near
the welding point as possible.
● If the radio has an anti-theft code and the battery has been disconnected, the code must be re-entered
before the radio will function properly.

Wheels and tires
pg. 5:1 Wheels and tires
Wheels and tires
The handling and riding comfort of the vehicle is dependent on the inflation pressure and the type of
tires fitted. Read the following pages carefully.
5:2 General information
5:3 Tread wear indicators
5:4 Inflation pressure
pg. 5:2 Wheels and tires (cont.)
General information
Your vehicle is equipped with tires according to the tire information label located on the rear facing side
of the right front door.
Wheels:
6" x 15" steel wheels
6" x 15" alloy wheels (certain models)
Tires:
185/65 R 15
195/65 R 15 (certain models)
The tire designation is coded as follows:
195 = tire width in mm.
60 = tire profile. This is the relationship (in percent) between the section height and the width of the tire.
R = radial tires.
15 = diameter in inches
The tires have good road holding characteristics and offer good handling on dry and wet surfaces.
Certain models are equipped with "all-season" tires, which provide a somewhat higher degree of winter
roadholding than tires without the "all-season" rating. However, for optimum road holding on icy or
snow covered roads - we recommend suitable winter tires on.
When replacing tires, be sure that the new tires are the same size designation, type (radial) and
preferably from the same manufacturer, on all four wheels. Otherwise there is a risk of altering the car's
road-holding and handling characteristics.

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_5_1.html (1 of 5)12/30/2006 9:44:30 AM

1993 Volvo 940

NOTE: When storing wheel/tire assemblies (e.g. winter tires and wheels), either lay the assemblies on
their sides or suspend them off the ground. Laying wheel/tire assemblies on their sides for prolonged
periods can cause wheel and/or tire damage.
Snow chains
Snow tire chains can be used on your Volvo with the following restrictions:
Snow chains should be installed on your rear wheels only.
● Snow chains can be used on the tires and wheels provided as original production equipment with your
Volvo. If accessory, aftermarket or "custom" tires and wheels are installed and are wider than 205 mm,
chains CANNOT be used. Sufficient clearances between chains and brakes, suspension and components
must be maintained.
● Some strap-on type chains will interfere with brake components and therefore CANNOT be used.
●

CAUTION:
Check local regulations regarding the use of snow chains before installing.
● Always follow the chains manufacturer's installation instructions carefully. Install chains as tightly
as possible and re-tighten periodically.
● Never exceed the chain manufacture's specified maximum speed limit. (Under no circumstances
should that limit be higher than 30 mph (50 km/h).
● Avoid bumps, holes or sharp turns when driving with snow chains.
● The handling of the vehicle can be adversely affected when driving with chains. Avoid fast or sharp
turns as well as locked wheel braking.
●

pg. 5:3 Wheels and tires (cont.)
Wear indicator
The tires have a so-called "wear indicator" in the form of a number of narrow strips running across or
parallel to the tread. When approx. 1/16" (1.6 mm) is left on the tread, these strips show up and indicate
that the tire should be replaced.
Tires with less than 1/16" (1.6 mm) tread have a very poor grip in rain or snow.
When replacing worn tires, it is recommended that the tire be identical in type (radial) and size as the
one being replaced. Using a tire of the same make (manufacturer) will prevent alteration of the driving
characteristics of the vehicle.
To improve tire economy:
● Maintain correct tire pressure.

1993 Volvo 940

Drive smoothly: avoid fast starts, hard braking and tire screeching.
● Tire wear increases with speed.
● Do not change wheel location unless necessary.
● Correct front wheel alignment is very important. Unbalanced wheels impair tire economy and driving
comfort.
● Unbalanced wheels impair tire economy and driving comfort.
● Hitting curbs or potholes can damage the tires and/or wheels permanently.
●

Flat spots
All tires become warm during use. After cooling, when the vehicle is parked, the tires have a tendency to
distort slightly, forming flat spots. These flat spots can cause vibrations similar to the vibrations caused
by imbalanced wheels.
They do, however, disappear when the tire warms up. The degree to which the flat spots form depends
on the type of cord used in the tire. Remember that, in cold weather, it takes longer for the tire to warm
up and consequently longer for the flat spot to disappear.
Snow tires, studded tires *
Tires for winter use:
Use snow tires fitted to the standard 15" wheels (preferably steel).
Suitable tire size: 185/65R15 on all four wheels. Do not mix tires of different design, as this could
negatively affect overall tire road grip especially during slippery road conditions!
Studded tires should be run-in 300-600 miles (500-1000 km) during which the car should be driven as
smoothly as possible to give the studs the opportunity to seat properly in the tires. The car tires should
have the same rotational direction throughout their entire lifetime. In other words, if you wish to rotate
the wheels, make sure that the same wheels are always on the same side of the car.
NOTE: Regulations governing the use of studded tires may vary from one state or province to another.

WARNING! Special wheel rims for air dams
Only special wheel rims, tested and approved by Volvo, are suitable for use with the air dam installed
on the 940.
pg. 5:4 Wheels and tires
Checking and correcting tire pressure
Check the tire pressure when refueling.
The tire pressure should be corrected only when the tires are cold. With warm tires, correct only when

1993 Volvo 940

the pressure is too low. The tire temperature rises after driving just a few miles.
Vehicle Loading
The tires on your Volvo will perform to specifications at all normal loads when inflated as
recommended on the tire information label located on the rear facing side on the right front door. This
label lists both the tire and vehicle design limits.
Do not load your car beyond the load limits indicated.

NOTE: This label is a sample. See label on your car for correct
data.

NOTE:
To avoid excessive wear and the necessity of rebalancing, mark and reinstall wheels in same location
and position as before removal. To lessen the chance of imbalance, each wheel hub is equipped with a
guide stud to ensure that a removed wheel can be reinstalled in its original position (as when changing
over to winter tires/wheels). When reinstalling the wheel cap, allow a gap of approximately 1/5" (5
mm) between the cap and the rim to help prevent imbalance.
NOTE: The crank handle on the jack can be forlded out by pressing the nob on the handle downward

Jack attachment

There is a jack attachment adjacent to each wheel location. Hang the jack from the attachment (alt. 1) or
position the jack on the bar in the jack attachment (alt. 2) as shown in the illustration above and crank
while simultaneously guiding the base to the ground. The base of the jack must be flat on a level, firm,
non-slippery surface. Before raising the car check that the jack is still correctly positioned in the
attachment . Now raise the vehicle until the wheel is free of the ground. Unscrew the wheel nuts
completely and carefully remove the wheel so as not to damage the tread of the studs.

WARNING!
● The jack's hook engage the bar in the jack attachment (A). The car's weight must not rest on the
jack's attachment (B).
● Be sure the jack is on a firm, level, non-slippery surface.
● Never allow any part of your body to be extended under a car supported by a jack.
● Use the jack intended for the car when replacing a wheel. for any other job, use stands to support the
end of the car being worked on.
● Apply the parking brake, select position P (automatic transmission).
● Block the wheels standing on the ground. Use rigid wooden blocks or large stones.
● The jack should be kept well-greased.

Clean the contact surfaces on the wheel and hub. Lift the wheel and place it on the hub. Make sure that
you align the wheel with the guide stud on the wheel hub prior to installation. Install the wheel nuts
crosswise and tighten lightly. The bevelled side of the nuts should face the wheel. Lower the vehicle to
the ground and alternately tighten the nuts to 63 lbs. (85 Nm). Install the wheel cap.
Some models have a hub cap that extends to the wheel rim. The valve symbol on the inside of the hub
cap should be installed toward the valve. After driving for a short time, a gap of approximately 0.2" (5
mm) will develop between the wheel cover and the rim. This is normal.

Replacing wiper blades

Lift the wiper arm off the windshield and hold blade at right
angles to arm. Pinch the end of the plastic clip located at the
back of the arm.

Slide the wiper blade along the arm to release it from the
hook.
Install new blade (installation is the reverse of removal) and
make sure that it is properly attached to the wiper arm.

for reasons of safety, you should change the windshield
wiper blades as soon as they start to leave marks on the
windshield or fail to wipe efficiently and cleanly.

Car care
pg. 7:1 Car care
Car care includes not only maintaining the appearance of the car, but also protecting the car exterior
from the effects of air pollution, rain and mud.
The rustproofing compound under the car should be checked regularly and, if necessary, damaged areas
should be repaired.
The paintwork should also be touched up immediately, if damaged, to prevent rust formation.
7:2 Rustproofing
7:4 Paintwork damage
7:6 Washing the car
7:8 Cleaning the upholstery
pg. 7:2 Rustproofing
What causes rust
The two most common causes of rust to your car are:
The accumulation of road dirt and moisture in hard-to-get-at cavities and other areas under the car.
● The removal of paint and protective coatings on the outside of the car and underneath through damage
by stones, gravel or minor accidents.
●

Several factors influence the speed at which corrosion will occur:
The length of time various parts of a car stay wet. Parts of the car filled with road dirt and water
remain damp for long periods of time even after other parts have dried.
Particular attention should be paid to the underside of the car and floor sections inside. The floor
sections stay wet because moisture collects and remains under the floor matting.
Drain holes located at the bottom of the doors can get clogged with dirt, trapping water inside the door
and causing the door to rust at the bottom.
● Corrosion will be accelerated in areas of higher relative humidity, especially where temperatures often
stay above the freezing point and where the atmosphere is affected by industrial pollution, or where salt
is used for de-icing the roads.
Where parts of the car are covered with road dirt containing road salt, corrosion will be accelerated at
lower relative humidity than if the surface were clean.
● Increased temperature will cause an accelerated rate of corrosion of those parts of the car which are
not well ventilated to permit quick drying.
●

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_7_1.html (1 of 10)12/30/2006 9:44:34 AM

1993 Volvo 940
●

Industrial pollution and the presence of salt will also accelerate the deterioration of paint finishes.

The foregoing identifies the need for every car owner to keep his or her car-particularly the underside-as
clean and dry as possible and to repair any minor damage to paintwork and protective coating as soon as
possible.
The need is more important in those areas where road salt is used for de-icing, the relative humidity is
higher, air pollution is present, and temperatures regularly stay above freezing.
Rustproofing, inspection and touching-up
Your Volvo was carefully and thoroughly rustproofed at the factory.
The underbody and wheelhousings were sprayed with a thick, durable rustproofing compound and the
beams, internal cavities and end sections were sprayed with a low viscous, penetrating rustproofing
agent.
There are two very effective methods of maintaining this protection:
● Keep your car clean.
Clean the underbody, wheelhousings and the edges of the fenders using water at high pressure.
● Inspect and touch-up the rustproofing if necessary.
The invisible (internal) rustproofing
As part of your maintenance schedule, it is important that the invisible rustproofing (used for beams,
internal cavities and end sections) be retreated first after 36 months and, thereafter, every 24 months.
Bear in mind, if good results are to be obtained, that these sections must be treated with a fine spray of
Volvo-approved rustproofing compound by your authorized Volvo dealer.
pg. 7:3 Rustproofing
The visible rustproofing
The visible (external) rustproofing must be inspected by an authorized Volvo dealer at 20,000 mile
(32,000 km) intervals. If it is necessary to touch-up the rustproofing, this should be done immediately to
prevent moisture penetration. Wash and dry thoroughly before touching up. Use spray-on or brush-on
rustproofing compounds.
There are two different types of rustproofing compounds available:
a. thin (transparent) for visible parts.
b. thick, for parts on the underbody and wheel housing which experience most wear.
Parts of the car which may need to be touched up and the recommended rustproofing compound are:
● visible welded seams and panel seams-(thin)
● underbody and wheel housings-(thick)
● door hinges-(thin)

1993 Volvo 940
●

hood hinges and locks-(thin).

After completion of all work on the vehicle, remove excess rustproofing compound with a cloth soaked
in kerosene.
The sheet metal surfaces of the engine compartment are protected by a transparent wax-based
rustproofing compound. The compound withstands normal washings without deterioration.
Mineral based solvents will, however, dissolve the compound, especially so if they contain emulsifiers.
In such cases the wax protection should be renewed.

pg. 7:4 Paint touch-up
Paint touch-up
Paint damage requires immediate attention to avoid rusting. Make it a habit to check the finish regularly;
when washing the car for instance. Touch up if necessary. Paint repairs require special equipment and
skill. Contact your Volvo dealer for any extensive damages.
Minor scratches can be repaired by using Volvo touch-up paint.

NOTE: When ordering touch-up paint from your Volvo dealer, use the paint code indicated on the
model plate. The plate is located on the panel above the right-side head lights.
NOTE: When touching up the car, it should be cleaned and dry. The surface temperature should be
above 60°F (+15°C).

Minor stone chips and scratches
Material:
● Primer - can
● Paint - touch-up bottle
● Masking tape
● Brush
If the stone chip has not penetrated down to the metal and undamaged layer of paint remains, the touchup paint can be applied as soon as the spot has been cleaned.
If the stone chip has been penetrated down to the metal, proceed as follows:
1 Place a strip of masking tape over the damaged surface. Pull the tape off so that any loose flakes of
paint adhere to it.

Remove loose flakes of paint with masking tape
2 Thoroughly mix the primer and apply it with a small brush.

Material:
● Primer - spray
● Paint - spray
● Masking tape

NOTE:
When touching up the car, it should be well cleaned and dry and have a temperature exceeding 60°F
(+15°C).
Mask with tape and paper prior to painting larger surfaces. Remove the masking immediately after
application of the last paint coat, before the paint starts to dry.

Touching up is as follows:
● Remove paint flakes with masking tape.
● Shake the spray can for at least 1 minute. Spray on the primer. Move the can slowly and evenly back
and forth over the spot and about 8-12 in. ( 20 - 30 cm) from the surface. Protect the surrounding
surfaces with suitable paper.

WARNING!
Spray painting should be done in a well ventilated and dust-free
area.
When the primer has dried, apply the surface enamel in the same way. Spray on several times and
allow the paint to dry a minute or so between each application.

pg. 7:6 Washing
Washing the car
The car should be washed at regular intervals since dirt, dust, insects and tar spots adhere to the paint
and may cause damage.
When washing the car, do not expose it to direct sunlight. Use lukewarm water to soften the dirt before
you wash with a sponge, and plenty of water, to avoid scratching.
A detergent can be used to facilitate the softening of dirt and oil. A water-soluble grease solvent may be
used in cases of sticky dirt.
However, use a washplace equipped with a drainage separator.
Dry the car with a clean chamois and remember to clean the drain holes in the doors and rocker panels.
The power radio antenna must be dried after washing.
Tar spots can be removed with kerosene or tar remover after the car bas been washed.
After washing the engine, the spark plug wells should be blown dry.
A stiff-bristle brush and lukewarm soapy water can be used to clean the wiper blades. Frequent cleaning
improves visibility considerably.
During high pressure washing the spray mouthpiece must never be closer to the vehicle than 13" (30
cm). Do not spray into locks.

NOTE:
It is particularly important to wash the car frequently in the wintertime to prevent corrosion, when salt
has been used on the roads. Also wash off the dirt from the underside (wheel housings fenders, etc..)
In areas of high industrial fallout more frequent washing is also recommended.
Suitable detergents
Special car washing detergents or liquid dishwashing detergent can be used. A suitable mixture is about
2.5 fl. oz. (8.5 cl.) of detergent to 2.6 US gal. (10 liters) of warm water. After washing with a detergent
the car should be well rinsed with clean water.
Bird droppings
Remove from paintwork as soon as possible. Otherwise the finish may be permanently damaged.

WARNING!
When the car is driven immediately after being washed, apply the brake several times in order to
remove any moisture from the brake linings.
Engine cleaning agents should not be used when the engine is warm. This constitutes a fire risk.

NOTE: When washing the car, remember to remove dirt from the drain holes in the doors and
sills.
pg. 7:7 Automatic car washing, Polishing and waxing, Chromed parts
Automatic washing - simple and quick
An automatic wash is a simple and quick way to clean your car. Keeping the underbody clean is most
important, especially in the winter. Some automatic washers do not have the facilities for washing the
underbody. Before driving into an automatic wash, make sure that the side view mirrors, auxiliary
lamps, etc., are secure, otherwise there is risk of the machine dislodging them. You should also lower
the antenna. We recommended that you do not wash your car in an automatic wash during the first six
months (because the paint will not have hardened sufficiently).
Polishing and waxing
Normally, polishing is not required during the first year after delivery, however, waxing may be
beneficial.
Before applying polish or wax the car must be washed and dried. Tar spots can be removed with
kerosene or tar remover. Difficult spots may require a fine rubbing compound.
After polishing use liquid or paste wax.
Several commercially-available products contain both polish and wax. Waxing alone does not substitute
for polishing of a dull surface.
A wide range of polymer-based car waxes can be purchased today.
The waxes are easy to use and produce a long-lasting, high-gloss finish that protects the bodywork
against oxidation, road dirt and fading.
Chromed parts

1993 Volvo 940

Chromium-plated and anodized parts should be washed with clean water as soon as they become dirty.
This is particularly important if you drive on gravel roads or on roads where salt is used during the
winter. After the car has been washed, apply wax or an anti-rust preparation.
Stains on chrome trim can be removed with commercially-available chrome cleaner. Do not use abrasive
compounds or steel wool.
pg. 7:8 Cleaning the upholstery
Cleaning the upholstery
Volvo recommends the use of Volvo approving cleaning products which are available at your authorized
Volvo dealer.
The fabric can be cleaned with soapy water or a detergent. for more difficult spots caused by oil, ice
cream, shoe polish, grease, etc.., use a clothing/clothing fabric stain remover.
The plastic in the upholstery can be washed with soapy water or a mild detergent.
Leather upholstery can be cleaned with a soft cloth and mild soap solution.
for more difficult spots, consult your Volvo dealer.
On no account must gasoline, naphtha or similar cleaning agents be used on the plastic or the leather
since these can cause damage.
Cleaning the seat belts
Clean only with lukewarm water and mild soap solution.
Cleaning floor mats
The floor mats should be vacuumed or brushed clean regularly, especially during the winter when they
should be taken out for drying. Spots on textile mats can be removed with a mild detergent.
Bear in mind
●
●
●

Take extra care when removing stains such as ink or lipstick since the coloring can spread.
Use solvents sparingly. Too much solvent can damage the seat padding.
Start from the outside of the stain and work toward the center.

pg. 8:5 Engine oil
Checking the oil level
The oil level should be checked every time the car is refuelled. Be sure the oil level is maintained
between the upper and lower marks on the dip-stick. Low oil level can cause internal damage to the
engine and over-filling can result in high oil consumption. The distance between the dipstick marks
represents approx. 1 US qt (1 liter) of oil.

Draining the oil
Drain the oil after driving while it is still hot.

Warning!
The oil may be very
hot.
To add or change engine oil
Add oil of the same kind as already used. Capacity: 4.0 us qts = 3.85 liters incl. filter*
After an oil change, the oil level will lie between the two marks on the dipstick i.e. between MAX and
MIN. This is normal. Do not add too much oil or excessive oil consumption will result.
* if oil cooler (Turbo models) is drained, add 0.7 US qts (0.6 liters).

Warning!
Oil spilled on a hot exhaust pipe constitutes a fire
risk.
Changing oil filter
Replace the oil filter at every oil change.
If you change the engine oil and filter yourself, your Volvo dealer can assist you in disposing of the used
oil. Engine oil can be harmful to your skin - gloves should be worn when performing this work.
pg. 8:6 Engine oil (cont.)
Oil quality
Meeting API specification SG
for best fuel economy and engine protection consult with your authorized Volvo dealer for
recommended oils. Oil with designation SG/CD complies with this requirement. Oil with a different
quality rating may not provide adequate engine protection.
Viscosity (stable ambient temperatures):

file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_8_1.html (6 of 8)12/30/2006 9:44:35 AM

1993 Volvo 940

Do not use oils with other viscosity ratings. The use of incorrect viscosity oil can shorten engine life.
Volvo recommends the use of energy-conserving oils. Look for the API label. Synthetic oils complying
with oil quality requirements are recommended for: driving in areas of sustained temperature extremes
(hot or cold), when towing a trailer over long distances or for a prolonged driving in mountainous areas.
Volvo does not recommend additional oil additives, as they can adversely affect the engine.
SAE 15W/40 is recommended for use in driving conditions that raise oil temperature and increase oil
consumption (i.e., mountain driving; trailer towing).
NOTE: SAE 15W/40 must not be used at low ambient temperatures; see viscosity chart.
Changing oil and oil filter
Oil and oil filter changes should be made as specified in the following table:

If driving conditions include:

Then the correct oil/oil filter change interval is:

Extended periods of idling and/or low-speed
operation
● Frequent short trips (less than 7 miles = 11 km)
● Extended periods of driving in dusty and/or
sandy areas
● Trailer towing
● Driving in mountainous areas

EVERY 5,000 miles= 8,000 km OR EVERY 6
MONTHS, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST

pg. 8:13 Automatic transmission

Automatic transmission oil
Capacity: See "Specifications" section
Fluid type: Automatic Transmission Fluid type Dexron IID or IIE.
Replace: Every 20,000 miles (32,000 km).

Warning!
Oil spilled on a hot exhaust pipe constitutes a fire
risk.
A Cold transmission: oil temperature + 105°F (+40°C).
This is a normal temperature for the transmission after idling for about 10 minutes.
At oil temperature below + 105°F (+40°C), the level may be below the MIN mark.
B Warm transmission: oil temperature + 190°F (+90°C).
This temperature is reached after driving for about 30 minutes.
At oil temperature above +190°f (+90°c), THE LEVEL MAY BE ABOVE THE max MARK.

NOTE:
The engine should be idling when checking transmission fluid
level.
Check the oil level as follows:
Park the car on level surface with the engine idling.
Slowly move the selector lever through all gear positions and then to position P. Wait 2 minutes before
checking the oil level. As the illustration shows, the dipstick has a "Cold" and a "Warm" side. The oil level

should be between the MIN and MAX marks. Wipe the dipstick with a clean cloth.

Warning! The oil may be very
hot
Do not use rags that could leave lint on the dipstick.
The transmission is topped up via the dipstick tube.
The space between the MIN and MAX marks on the dipstick corresponds to 0.5 US qt (0.5 liter). Do not fill
the transmission with too much oil, since this can result in oil being ejected from the transmission.
Too little oil, on the other hand, can negatively affect transmission operation, particularly in very cold
weather.
pg. 8:14 Cooling system

If you change the coolant yourself, your Volvo dealer can also assist you in disposing of the used coolant.
Check coolant level
The cooling system must be filled with coolant and not leak to operate at maximum efficiency. Check the
coolant level regularly. The level should be between the "Max" and "Min" marks on the expansion tank. The
check should be made with particular thoroughness when the engine is new or when the cooling system has
been drained.
Do not remove the filler cap other than for topping-up with coolant. Frequent removal may prevent coolant
circulations between the engine tank during engine warm-up and cooling.
Changing coolant
Normally, the coolant does not need to be changed. If the system must be drained, use the following
procedure:
file:///K|/ownersdocs/1993/1993_940/93940_8_13.html (2 of 6)12/30/2006 9:44:36 AM

1993 Volvo 940

Remove the expansion tank cap. Open the drain cock on the right side of the engine block and disconnect the
lower radiator hose.
Fill coolant through the expansion tank. The heater controls should be fully open when draining and filling.
Add coolant until the level is up to the MAX mark or slightly above.
Start the engine and run until hot. Check the cooling system connections for tightness. Also re-check the
coolant level.
Capacity: See "Specifications"
Coolant: Volvo Genuine Coolant/Antifreeze only

CAUTION!
The cooling system must always be kept filled to correct level.
If it is not kept filled, there can be high local temperatures in the engine which could result in
damage.
Different types of anti-freeze/coolant may not be mixed.
WARNING: If the engine is warm and you are going to top up coolant, unscrew the cap slowly in order to
allow any excess pressure to escape.
NOTE: Do not top up with water only. Water by itself reduces the rust-protective and anti-freeze qualities of
the coolant and has a lower boiling point. It can also cause damage to the cooling system if it should freeze.

pg. 8:16 Drive belts

Checking the belt tension
The belt tension can be checked by depressing the fan belt (engine not running!) at a point midway between
the generator and fan. It should be possible to press down the belt about 1/4" - 3/8" (5-10 mm). This also
applies to other drive belts on the engine.

WARNING! The engine must not be running when this check is
performed.

1993 Volvo 940

Check the belt regularly to make sure it is in good condition and is clean. Worn or dirty belts can cause poor
cooling and low generator output as well as impair the operation of the power steering and the air conditioning
unit.
Belt adjustment and replacement
The belts can be difficult to reach and it is advisable to let your Volvo dealer adjust the tension of the belts or
replace them, if necessary.

pg. 8:7 Servicing
Valves
The valve clearance should be check and, if necessary, adjusted every 30,000 miles (48,000 km).
Air cleaner
Replace the air cleaner cartridge with a new one every 30,000 miles (48,000 km). The cartridge should
be replaced more often when driving under dirty and dusty conditions, The filter cannot be cleaned and,
therefore, should always be replaced with a new one.
Vacuum fittings, hoses and connections
Unstable idle, misfiring, or poor emission control is often caused by leaking vacuum hoses or
connections. Check hoses and connections on distributor vacuum unit, connections on heater control
servo systems and hydraulic brake servo.
Checking and adjusting idle air control system
Your Volvo is equipped with an electronically-controlled idle air control system that requires no
checking or adjustment.
Fuel system cap, tank and lines, and connections
The effectiveness of the fuel system to contain hydrocarbons is dependent largely on a leakfree system.
Check for proper sealing of gasoline filler cap which contains "0" ring-type seals. Check all evaporative
hoses in vehicle for tightness. Check fuel lines under vehicle and repair if necessary.
Fuel (line) filter
The fuel line filter is located next to the fuel pump. This filter should be replaced every 100,000 miles
(160,000 km). The filter is replaced as one complete unit.
Replace more frequently if contaminated fuel is introduced into the tank (or if there is reason to suspect
that this has occurred).

Fuel system
The fuel injection system is all-electronic and microprocessor-controlled. It can continually compensate
for variations in engine load, speed and temperature to give the best economy and power. A mass air
flow sensor or a pressure meter on certain models, measures the inducted air. In this way the system can
make instantaneous adjustments for changes in air temperature or density, thus always assuring the best
economy with the lowest possible exhaust emissions.
Heated oxygen sensor
This is an emission control system designed to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy. The heated
oxygen sensor monitors the composition of the exhaust gases leaving the engine. The exhaust gas
analysis is fed into an electronic control module. This adjusts the air-fuel ratio to provide optimum
conditions for combustion and efficient reduction of the three major pollutants (hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide and nitrous gases) by a three-way catalytic converter.
Pulsed Secondary Air Injection
(certain models)
This system adds air to the hot exhaust gases as they are expelled from the engine. This causes a
secondary combustion of residual hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, resulting in lower emissions
levels in the exhaust gases.

1993 Volvo 940

pg. 8:9 Servicing (cont.)

Three-way Catalytic Converter
This is a supplementary device in the exhaust system, designed to clean exhaust gases. This device is
mainly a container with a ceramic material insert, designed to let the exhaust gases pass through
channels in the insert. The channel walls are covered by a thin layer of platinum-palladium. These
metals act as catalysts, permitting a chemical action to occur without actually taking part in it. The
emission (CO, HC, NOx) content will increase if the three-way catalytic converter is damaged. Vehicles
equipped with heated oxygen sensors use three-way catalytic converters containing platinum and
rhodium.

CAUTION:
Vehicles with a three-way catalytic converter must use unleaded fuel only. Otherwise the three-way
catalytic converter will become ineffective. See "Fuel requirements".

Charge air cooler (Intercooler)
The B230F-Turbo engine employs a turbocompressor to force air into the engine inlet manifold and a
charge air cooler to cool the compressed inlet air. The resulting increase in air flow raises pressure in the
intake manifold by approx. 8 psi (over atmospheric pressure) and engine power output by approx. 46
horsepower over that developed by the normally-aspirated engine.
The charge air cooler (which resembles a radiator) is located between the turbocompressor and inlet
manifold.
pg. 8:10 Servicing (cont.)

Evaporative control system
The 940 is equipped with a gas-evaporative control system, which prevents gasoline fumes from being
released into the atmosphere. The system is comprised of an expansion chamber in the fuel tank, and a

charcoal canister with built-in vacuum valve under the left-front wheel housing. The components are
interconnected by hoses which channel fuel vapor from the gas tank to the charcoal filter, where it is
stored until the engine is started and then drawn into the engine's fuel-induction system.

Crankcase ventilation
The engine is equipped with positive crankcase ventilation which prevents crankcase gases from being
released into the atmosphere. Instead, the crankcase gases are admitted to the intake manifold and
cylinders.
PCV system
The PCV nipple in the intake manifold should be removed and inspected every 60,000 miles (96,000
km).
Check/replace hoses at the same time.
Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)
This system operates by returning some of the exhaust gases to the engine to be recombusted: since this
lowers the combustion temperature the amount of nitrogen oxides released into the atmosphere is
reduced.
The EGR valve should be cleaned at 100,000 miles (160,000 km) and thereafter cleaned every 20,000
miles (32,000 km).
* B 230 FD only: clean at 100,000 miles (160,000 km).

WARNING!
The distributor ignition system operates at very high voltages. Special safety precautions must be
followed to prevent injury.
Always turn the ignition off when:
● connecting engine test and diagnostic equipment to the vehicle (timing light, tach-dwell tester,
ignition oscilloscope, etc..).
● Replacing distributor ignition components e.g. plugs, coil, distributor, HT leads etc.
● Do not touch any part of the distributor ignition system while the engine is running. This may result
in unintended movements and body injury.
Replacing spark plugs
The spark plugs should be changed every 30,000 miles (48,000 km). However, city driving or fast
highway driving may necessitate changing after 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of driving. When installing
new plugs, be sure to fit the right type and use correct torque, see Specifications. When changing the
plugs, check that the suppressor connectors are in good condition. Cracked or damaged connectors
should be replaced. When changing the spark plugs, clean the terminals and the rubber seals.

CAUTION: Do not use silicone-based lubricants, which can have adverse effects on electrical
components.
Battery:
Make sure the battery leads are properly connected and tightened.
● Never disconnect the battery when the engine is running.
● The battery leads must be disconnected when recharging the battery.
● Turn radio off before disconnecting the battery. If the radio has an anti-theft code and the battery has
been disconnected, the code must be re-entered before the radio will function properly.
●

Batteries contain corrosive and toxic acids. It is of the utmost importance that old batteries are disposed
of correctly. Your Volvo dealer can assist you in this matter.
