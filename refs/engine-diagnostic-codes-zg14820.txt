Volvo Self-Diagnostics
960

INTRODUCTION
If no faults were found while performing BASIC DIAGNOSTIC
PROCEDURES, proceed with SELF-DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM. If no fault codes or
only pass codes are present, proceed to H - TESTS W/O CODES article in
the ENGINE PERFORMANCE Section for diagnosis by symptom (i.e., ROUGH
IDLE, NO START, etc.).
NOTE:

All voltage tests should be performed using a Digital
Volt-Ohmmeter (DVOM) with a minimum 10-megohm input
impedance, unless specifically stated otherwise in testing
procedures.

SELF-DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM
960 uses a Motronic 1.8 diagnostic system, which uses a
single Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to control fuel injection and
ignition systems. In addition, Motronic 1.8 diagnostic system
determines whether A/C compressor may be switched on, reduces engine
torque in response to a signal from automatic transmission, and
controls radiator fan.
Diagnostic unit for retrieving codes is located in engine
compartment, in front of left strut assembly. Diagnostic unit is
equipped with an LED indicator, activation button and function select
cable. See Fig. 1.
Diagnostic unit output socket No. 2 is used to retrieve all
codes. Once selector cable has been inserted in correct slot,
depressing button once, twice or 3 times selects from one of 3 control
(fault tracing) functions. Faults stored in ECU memory are read by
observing LED flashes. Diagnostic system stores 18 fault codes.
All fault codes contain 3 digits (example: 4-1-3). Since
codes have 3 digits, each code requires 3 series of flashes. A 3second interval separates series of flashes. See Fig. 2.

RETRIEVING CODES
CAUTION: Never disconnect or connect ECU connector with ignition
switch in ON position. Ensure ignition is off and fuse No.
24 is removed.
ECU is equipped with diagnostic functions in form of selfdiagnostics (Test Mode No. 1), function testing (Test Mode No. 2) and
control testing (Test Mode No. 3). Access to diagnostic system is
provided by socket No. 2 on diagnostic unit with ignition on.
Test Mode No. 1 (Retrieving Codes)
1) ECU can record 18 fault codes. Fault codes stored in
memory can be displayed by pressing test button "A" on diagnostic unit
for an instant. Control unit memory can retain codes from 10 minutes
to 24 hours after interruption of electrical supply.
2) Control unit will begin to use a faulty or missing signal
immediately after it has been corrected rather than remaining in limphome mode. Fault code, however, will remain in memory.
3) To retrieve codes, open diagnostic unit cover and connect
test lead to socket No. 2. Turn ignition on. Enter test mode No. 1 by
pressing test button once for 1-3 seconds.
4) Observe LED, and count number of flashes in 3 digit series
comprising a fault code. Because series are displayed at 3-second
intervals, codes can be easily distinguished.
5) If a fault code is retrieved, refer to FAULT CODES table
under FAULT CODE DEFINITION. Depress push button again, and check for
additional codes. Depress push button a third time if necessary. If
first code repeats, no other codes are present. Control unit can store
all 18 codes simultaneously.
Test Mode No. 2
This function is activated by briefly pressing test button
"A" 2 times, causing LED to rapidly flash. Control unit will flash a
code indicating receipt of a signal from following components:
*
*
*
*
*
*

3-3-2 - Throttle switch (throttle moved from idle).
3-3-3 - Throttle switch (throttle moved from WOT).
1-2-4 - Starter inhibitor switch, when gear selector is moved
from a drive position to N or P.
1-4-1 - Timing pick-up, when starter motor is running.
1-1-4 - ECC control panel, when A/C button is depressed or
released.
1-3-4 - Relay in ECC power unit energizing A/C compressor
clutch when A/C is on.
Test Mode No. 3

This function is activated by briefly pressing test button
"A" 3 times. Control unit will respond by activating following
components in order:
*
*
*
*
*

Radiator fan at half speed for 3 seconds.
Radiator fan at full speed for 3 seconds.
Fuel injectors.
Idling (CIS) valve.
Relay in ECC power unit, resulting in A/C clutch operation.

FAULT CODE TESTING

Code 1-3-1 Or 2-1-4 (Timing Pick-Up Signal)
1) Enter test mode No. 2. See TEST MODE NO. 2 under
RETRIEVING CODES. Operate starter motor. Code 1-4-1, indicating a
timing pick-up signal, should be displayed.
2) Disconnect ECU connector. Connect a voltmeter capable of
measuring millivolts between ECU connector terminals No. 47 (Pink
wire) and No. 48 (White/Black wire). Operate starter motor. Voltmeter
should indicate 300-400 millivolts.

3) Turn ignition off. Connect an ohmmeter between timing
pick-up connector terminals No. 47 (Pink wire) and No. 48 (White/Black
wire). Resistance should be approximately 200-400 ohms.
4) Reconnect ECU with Measuring Unit (999-3070) connected to
ECU. See Fig. 3. Connect an ohmmeter between measuring unit terminals
No. 48 and 19. Resistance should be zero ohms. Measure resistance
between terminals No. 48 and 30. Resistance should be zero ohms. On
automatic transmission equipped vehicles, check test mode No. 1 if
speed signal fault code is displayed. See TEST MODE NO. 1 under
RETRIEVING CODES.

Code 1-3-2 (Battery Voltage)
1) This code is set if battery voltage decreases to less than

8 volts or exceeds 16 volts for 5 seconds after engine start. To
check, connect Measuring Unit (999-3070) to ECU. See Fig. 3. Connect
voltmeter between measuring unit terminals No. 18 and 19.
2) Start engine and check battery voltage. Check battery and
charging system if voltage is too low or high.
Code 1-4-3 Or 4-3-3 (No Front/Rear Knock Sensor Signal)
Disconnect knock sensor connector and jumper terminals.
Measure resistance between knock sensor terminal No. 2 (Green/Gray
wire) and terminal No. 11 (Green wire) or terminal No. 29
(Brown/Orange wire), depending upon whether front or rear knock sensor
is being checked. If zero ohms is present, replace knock sensor.
Tighten sensor to 15 ft. lbs. (20 N.m).
Code 2-2-3 (No Idle Valve Signal)
1) Check operation of idle valve in test mode No. 3. See TEST
MODE NO. 3 under RETRIEVING CODES. If valve does not operate, check
wiring.
2) Connect Measuring Unit (999-3070) to ECU. See Fig. 3.
Start engine. Connect voltmeter between measuring unit terminals No. 4
and 24. Approximately 11 volts should be present. Connect voltmeter
between measuring unit terminals No. 22 and 24. Approximately 7.5
volts should be present.
3) Turn engine off (ignition on). Using a voltmeter, check
voltage at measuring unit terminals No. 4 and 22. Voltage should be
approximately 8-9 volts. If no voltage is present, check wiring to
idle valve.
4) Turn ignition off. Using an ohmmeter, check resistance
across measuring unit terminals No. 4 and 22. Resistance should be
approximately 25 ohms. If not, replace idle valve.
Code 2-3-1 (Lambda Control Rich Or Lean In Part-Load Range)
Or Code 2-3-2 (Lambda Control Rich Or Lean At Idle)
1) Control unit receives information from oxygen sensor on
whether fuel/air mixture is too rich or too lean in part-load and
idling ranges. Control unit adaptive system compensates for this by
making mixture leaner or richer as necessary. If mixture must be
compensated excessively, a fault code is set.
2) Start engine. Connect voltmeter between terminals No. 1
and 2 in starter motor 2-pin connector. Voltmeter should indicate
battery voltage. If no voltage is present, check fuse No. 30.
3) Stop engine. Disconnect starter motor connector. Connect
ohmmeter between starter motor connector terminals No. 1 and 2.
Ohmmeter should show 3-13 ohms, depending on resistor temperature.
4) Connect Measuring Unit (999-3070) to ECU. See Fig. 3.
Start engine. Connect voltmeter between measuring unit terminals No.
28 and 30. After a short interval, voltmeter should oscillate between
0.1-1.0 volt.
5) If voltage remains constant at zero volts, sensor is
interpreting fuel/air mixture as lean. If voltage is constant at one
volt, sensor is interpreting fuel/air mixture as rich.
6) If either fault code 2-3-1 or 2-3-2 is displayed and
voltmeter is oscillating between 0.1-1.0 volt, Lambda control is
correctly adjusting CO content even though ECU is indicating fault.
Code 2-3-3 (Idle Control Not In Range)
1) If control unit has to open or close idling valve too much
to maintain constant idling conditions, control unit will interpret
this as a fault and record a fault code.
2) Start engine, and run it until it reaches normal operating
temperature. Ensure gear selector is in Neutral and A/C is off. To
determine whether an air leak is present, clamp air valve hose and
observe engine speed. If engine speed exceeds 600-700 RPM, air leakage

is present or throttle disc is incorrectly adjusted.
Code 2-4-1 (EGR Flow Too Low)
1) Enter test mode No. 3. See TEST MODE NO. 3 under
RETRIEVING CODES. Turn ignition on. Press test button on diagnostic
unit 3 times for more than one second each. Light should flash as EGR
converter is activated. Turn ignition off.
2) If EGR converter is not activated, measure resistance
between pins No. 6 (Blue wire) and No. 15 (Red/Green wire). Resistance
should be about 75-95 ohms. If resistance is not as specified, check
wiring and connectors.
3) Disconnect EGR converter connector, located next to power
steering fluid reservoir. See Fig. 4. Remove wire directly opposite
Black/White wire between pin No. 1 and control unit. Reconnect
connector.
4) Start engine, and run it until it reaches normal operating
temperature. Touch loose lead to engine ground. If engine starts to
run unevenly, EGR system is operating correctly.

Code 2-4-3 (Throttle Switch Signal Absent Or Faulty)
1) Enter test mode No. 2. See TEST MODE NO. 2 under

RETRIEVING CODES. Turn throttle slightly. Throttle function is correct
in idling position if flashing code 3-3-2 is displayed.
2) Turn throttle to full-load position and release. Throttle
function is correct in full-load position if flashing code 3-3-3 is
displayed.
3) Connect Measuring Unit (999-3070) to ECU. See Fig. 3. Turn
ignition on. Connect voltmeter between measuring unit terminals No. 30
and 53. Voltmeter should indicate about 0.5 volts at idle and about 4.
5 volts at full load.
4) Connect voltmeter between measuring unit terminals No. 12
and 30. Voltmeter should indicate 5 volts. Turn ignition off. Ensure
measuring unit terminal No. 30 is grounded. Connect an ohmmeter
between measuring unit terminals No. 19 and 30. Ohmmeter should
indicate zero ohms.
Code 3-1-1 (Speedometer Signal)
1) Control unit is dependent on this signal for WOT
enrichment, fan control, etc. A fault code will be set if speed
exceeds 3390 RPM, load signal corresponds to part load and signal is
absent for 3 seconds.
2) To check speedometer signal, raise vehicle with rear
wheels suspended. Connect Measuring Unit (999-3070) to ECU. See
Fig. 3. Connect voltmeter between measuring unit terminals No. 9 and
19. Turn ignition on. Spin rear wheels, and check voltmeter. Voltage
should be 0.1-12.0 volts.
3) If voltage is not present, check wiring between control
unit and instrument cluster. Connect ohmmeter between measuring unit
terminal No. 9 and terminal at rear of instrument cluster
(Green/Orange wire). Ohmmeter should indicate zero ohms.
4) If no reading is obtained, check wiring between instrument
cluster and control unit. If reading is obtained, check wiring between
instrument cluster and rear axle. On A/T models, check test mode No. 1
if speed signal fault is obtained. See TEST MODE NO. 1 under
RETRIEVING CODES.
Code 3-1-4 (Camshaft Sensor Signal)
1) Camshaft sensor enables control unit to determine which
cylinder requires fuel and ignition. A fault code is recorded if
signal remains constantly high or low for more than 30 seconds.
2) To check camshaft sensor signal, remove fuse No. 31 to
prevent engine from starting and connect Measuring Unit (999-3070) to
ECU. See Fig. 3. Turn ignition switch to ON position. Connect
voltmeter across measuring unit terminals No. 8 and 19. Operate
starter motor. Voltage should oscillate between .1 and .5 volt.
Install fuse No. 31.
3) If signal is absent or faulty, ensure voltage across
measuring unit terminals No. 10 and 30 is about 11 volts. Turn
ignition off. Ensure measuring unit terminal No. 30 is grounded.
Connect an ohmmeter between measuring unit terminals No. 30 and 19.
Ohmmeter should indicate zero ohms.
Code 3-2-2 (Airflow Meter Hot Wire)
1) Approximately 4 volts is routed to platinum wire in
airflow meter from ECU terminal No. 5. Ground is supplied from ECU
terminal No. 7. Fault code is set if voltage between ground and
terminal No. 7 does not exceed 2.5 volts.
2) Turn ignition off. Connect Measuring Unit (999-3070) to
ECU. See Fig. 3. To ensure airflow meter is grounded, connect ohmmeter
between measuring unit terminals No. 19 and 26. Zero ohms should be
present. Connect ohmmeter between airflow meter connector terminal No.
1 (Brown wire) and ground. Reading should be about zero ohms.
3) Connect ohmmeter between measuring unit terminals No. 7
and 26. Reading should be about 2.5-4.0 ohms. If resistance is not to

specification, measure resistance between airflow meter terminals No.
2 (Brown/White wire) and No. 3 (Green/Yellow wire).
4) Turn ignition on. Connect voltmeter between measuring unit
terminals No. 7 and 19. About 1.4 volts should be present. Start
engine. Voltage should increase to 2.3-2.6 volts when idling. Voltage
should be 2.3 volts with engine hot.
5) If voltage reading is too low, connect voltmeter between
measuring unit terminals No. 25 and 19. Increase speed to 1800 RPM,
and stop engine. Voltage should be about 4 volts. On A/T models, check
test mode No. 1 if load signal fault code is displayed. See TEST MODE
NO. 1 under RETRIEVING CODES.
Code 4-3-1 (EGR Temperature Sensor Absent/Faulty)
Measure resistance between terminals No. 14 (Black wire) and
No. 22 (Yellow/Black wire). Resistance should be 500-1000 ohms. If
resistance is not 500-1000 ohms, check wiring, connectors and ground
terminal on intake manifold.

CLEARING CODES
1) Turn ignition on. Display fault codes. Operate test button
for more than 5 seconds. Release test button. LED should light after 3
seconds. Press button again for more than 5 seconds. Release button.
LED should be out.
2) Ensure fault codes have been cleared by pressing test
button once for more than one second (but not more than 3 seconds).
Fault codes have been cleared if code 1-1-1 is displayed.

ECU LOCATION
ECU is located above accelerator pedal.

SUMMARY
If no hard fault codes (or only pass codes) are present,
driveability symptoms exist or intermittent codes exist, proceed to
H - TESTS W/O CODES article in the ENGINE PERFORMANCE Section for
diagnosis by symptom (i.e., ROUGH IDLE, NO START, etc.) or
intermittent diagnostic procedures.
