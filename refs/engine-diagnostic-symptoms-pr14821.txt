INTRODUCTION
Before diagnosing symptoms or intermittent faults, perform
steps in appropriate F - BASIC TESTING and G - TESTS W/ CODES
articles in the ENGINE PERFORMANCE Section, see below. Use this
article to diagnose driveability problems existing when a hard fault
code is not present or if vehicle is not equipped with a selfdiagnostic system.

Some driveability problems may have been corrected by
manufacturer with a revised computer calibration chip or
computer control unit. Check with manufacturer for latest
chip or computer application.

Symptom checks can direct the technician to malfunctioning
component(s) for further diagnosis. A symptom should lead to a
specific component, system test or adjustment.
Use intermittent test procedures to locate driveability
problems that do not occur when the vehicle is being tested. These
test procedures should also be used if a soft (intermittent) trouble
code was present but no problem was found during self-diagnostic
testing.
NOTE:

For testing procedures, see I - SYSTEM/COMPONENT TESTS
article in the ENGINE PERFORMANCE Section. For
specifications, see D - ADJUSTMENTS article or
C - SPECIFICATIONS article in the ENGINE PERFORMANCE
Section.

SYMPTOMS
SYMPTOM DIAGNOSIS
Symptom checks cannot be used properly unless problem occurs
while vehicle is being tested. To reduce diagnostic time, ensure steps
in appropriate F - BASIC TESTING and G - TESTS W/ CODES articles in
the ENGINE PERFORMANCE Section, see below were performed before
diagnosing a symptom. Symptoms available for diagnosis include:

INTERMITTENTS
INTERMITTENT PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS
Intermittent fault testing requires duplicating circuit or
component failure to identify the problem. These procedures may lead
to the computer setting a fault code (on some systems) which may help
in diagnosis.
If problem vehicle does not produce fault codes, monitor
voltage or resistance values using a DVOM while attempting to
reproduce conditions causing intermittent fault. A status change on
DVOM indicates a fault has been located.
Use a DVOM to pinpoint faults. When monitoring voltage,
ensure ignition switch is in ON position or engine is running. Ensure
ignition switch is in OFF position or negative battery cable is
disconnected when monitoring circuit resistance. Status changes on
DVOM during test procedures indicate area of fault.

TEST PROCEDURES
Intermittent Simulation
To reproduce conditions creating an intermittent fault:
*
*
*
*
*

Lightly vibrate component.
Heat component.
Wiggle or bend wiring harnesses.
Spray component with water mist.
Remove/apply vacuum source.

Monitor circuit/component voltage or resistance while simulating
intermittent. If engine is running, monitor for self-diagnostic codes.
Use test results to identify a faulty component or circuit.
