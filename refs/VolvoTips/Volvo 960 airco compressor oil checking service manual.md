### VOLVO 960 A/C COMPRESSOR REFRIGERANT OIL CHECKING

1994 A/C Compressor Refrigerant Oil Checking Volvo 850, 940, 960

#### PLEASE READ THIS FIRST

NOTE: For COMPRESSOR APPLICATION and REFRIGERANT OIL & REFRIGERANT SPECIFICATIONS tables, see the A/C COMPRESSOR SERVICING

article in the AIR CONDITIONING & HEAT section. DO NOT exceed A/C system refrigerant oil capacity when servicing system.

#### REFRIGERANT OIL

Only NEW, moisture-free refrigerant oil should be used in the air conditioning system. This oil is highly refined and dehydrated so moisture content is less than 10 parts per million. The oil container must be tightly closed at all times when not in use, or moisture from the air will be absorbed into the refrigerant oil.

#### SERVICING PRECAUTIONS

DISCHARGING SYSTEM

Discharge A/C system using approved refrigerant recovery/ recycling equipment. Always follow recovery/recycling equipment manufacturer’s instructions. After refrigerant recovery process is completed, the amount of compressor oil removed must be measured and the same amount added to A/C system.

DISCONNECTING LINES & FITTINGS

After system is discharged, carefully clean area around all fittings to be opened. Always use 2 wrenches when tightening or loosening fittings. Some refrigerant lines are connected with a coupling. Special tools may be required to disconnect lines. Cap or plug all openings as soon as lines are removed. DO NOT remove caps until connections of lines and fittings are completed.

CONNECTING LINES & FITTINGS

NOTE: All R-134a based systems use 1/2″-16 ACME threaded fittings.

Ensure all replacement parts match the connections of the system being worked on.

Always use a new gasket or “O” ring when connecting lines or fittings. Coat “O” ring with refrigerant oil and ensure it is not twisted during installation. Always use 2 wrenches to prevent damage to lines and fittings.

PLACING SYSTEM IN OPERATION

After component service or replacement has been completed and all connections have been made, evacuate system thoroughly with a vacuum pump. Charge system with proper amount of refrigerant and perform leak test. See REFRIGERANT OIL & REFRIGERANT SPECIFICATIONS TABLE in the A/C COMPRESSOR SERVICING article for system capacities. Check all fittings that have been opened. After system has been leak

tested, check system performance.

NOTE: Most compressors are pre-charged with a fixed amount of refrigerant (shipping) oil. Drain compressor oil from new compressor and add refrigerant oil to new compressor according to amount removed from old compressor. Always refer to underhood A/C specification label or A/C compressor label while servicing A/C system.

#### CHECKING COMPRESSOR OIL

SANDEN – 7-CYLINDER

NOTE: Volvo compressor oil checking procedures are not available from manufacturer.

ZEXEL – 6-CYLINDER

1.  Discharge refrigerant. See SERVICING PRECAUTIONS. Remove compressor from vehicle. Drain compressor oil from compressor drain plug and measure oil amount. Add the same amount of oil as was drained from the old compressor.
    
2.  Add 1 2/3 ounces of refrigerant oil when replacing evaporator. When replacing condenser or hoses, add 2/3 ounce of refrigerant oil per component replaced. Add 3 ounces of refrigerant oil when replacing receiver-drier.
