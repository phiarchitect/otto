## AIR BAG RESTRAINT SYSTEM

1994 Volvo 960

1994 ACCESSORIES/SAFETY EQUIPMENT

Volvo Air Bags

940 & 960

## \* PLEASE READ THIS FIRST \*

WARNING: To avoid injury from accidental air bag deployment, read and carefully follow all WARNINGS and SERVICE PRECAUTIONS.

## IDENTIFICATION

All models equipped with Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) can be identified by SRS Labels. SRS labels can be found at following locations: on inside of hood; on driver-side visor and passenger-side of dashboard; on driver-side "B" pillar; and decal on left side of windshield. Models equipped with SRS will also have an SRS warning light mounted in instrument gauge cluster light bar.

## DESCRIPTION & OPERATION

Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) is designed to operate when vehicle strikes a rigid or heavy object with enough force to activate SRS. Activation impact area is directly in front of vehicle and 30 degrees on either side of dead center. SRS is not designed to activate during a side or rear collision, a rollover, or frontal collision at low speed or with soft objects.

Main SRS components include a driver-side air bag/gas generator module, mounted to steering wheel; passenger-side air bag/gas generator module, mounted to instrument panel (960 only); contact reel (clockspring), mounted in steering column, under steering wheel; crash sensor and standby power unit, mounted under driver’s seat; SRS warning light, mounted in instrument gauge cluster light bar. See Fig. 1. All models have an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) system located within engine compartment. All models have pyrotechnical seat belt tensioners for driver and front passenger seats. Seat belt tensioners are mounted inside "B" pillars. For SRS to operate properly, 3-point seat belts must be worn.

If vehicle’s deceleration rate, recorded by crash sensor, is sufficiently high, crash sensor delivers voltage signal to ignite gas generators in air bag module and in seat belt tensioners. When air bag module gas generator is ignited, a quantity of non-toxic nitrogen gas is produced, which fills air bag in a few hundredths of a second. Immediately after air bag inflates, gas is released through a ventilation hole on rear of air bag module. Entire sequence of air bag inflation and collapse takes about 0.2 seconds.

Seat belt tensioners are connected to seat belt reel by a cable. When seat belt tensioner is activated by crash sensor, belt is tightened about 4". In a collision, seat belt tensioners tighten seat belts instantly, holding occupant tightly against seat back.

NOTE: Volvo recommends air bag modules and seat belt tensioners be replaced every 10 years to maintain reliability.

AIR BAG MODULE

Each air bag module consists of an inflatable air bag and inflator unit. Gas generator and ignitor make up the inflator unit, which is mounted to rear of air bag module. A 2-pin electrical

connector with gold-plated terminals is mounted to inflator unit. If 2-pin connector is disconnected for any reason, a safety shorting spring inside 2-pin connector spreads open, touching both terminals. This prevents accidental air bag deployment by static electricity or careless handling.

CONTACT REEL (CLOCKSPRING)

Contact reel is a spirally wound wire coil (not a slip ring) mounted to steering column. This single-wire type contact reel design ensures the most reliable contact possible between air bag module assembly and crash sensor.

CRASH SENSOR

Crash sensor measures and records deceleration/collision force of vehicle to determine if air bag deployment is necessary. Crash sensor also functions as a diagnostic monitor, which continuously monitors SRS operation and records any faults in SRS. Crash sensor incorporates a piezoelectric sensor (to detect deceleration/collision force), microprocessors (to evaluate collision signal and control SRS deployment), a memory (to retain information for fault tracing if power supply fails) and a standby power unit (if battery power supply is lost).

Electrical sensor records combination of "G" force and change in speed (deceleration). Both high "G" force and prolonged deceleration are required to activate SRS. Consequently crash sensor

cannot be activated by a hammer blow or other similar influence, which produces a high "G" force for a short time.

To ensure correct operation of crash sensor, crash sensor must be properly secured to floor and securely grounded. Crash sensor is grounded by a short Black wire connected to one of crash sensor’s mounting screws. SRS is monitored continuously by microprocessors in the crash sensor, regardless of ignition switch position or engine operation. Crash sensor will illuminate instrument gauge cluster SRS warning light until a fault is corrected and crash sensor memory is cleared.

Crash sensor incorporates a standby power unit if normal power source (battery voltage) is interrupted. Standby power unit stores enough energy to deploy SRS within 100 milliseconds of battery power loss during a collision.

ON-BOARD DIAGNOSTIC UNIT

On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) unit, located within engine compartment, is a 2-part, interconnected unit with an "A" side and a "B" side. OBD unit is used to store fault codes, display fault codes and monitor SRS continuously by self-diagnostics. Fault codes are stored in crash sensor and displayed through OBD unit and/or SRS light on side "A" of OBD unit. See SELF-DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM under DIAGNOSIS & TESTING.

OBD unit is positioned on left front of engine compartment and is controlled by crash sensor located under driver seat.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM

SRS deployment harness connectors are Orange, except for passenger-side air bag module connector which is Violet. The SRS connectors between air bag module(s) and crash sensor have gold-plated terminals for maximum conductivity. These colored connectors contain a safety shorting spring in the male half of connector. When connectors are disconnected, safety shorting spring spreads open to touch both

terminals, preventing accidental deployment of air bag by static electricity or careless handling.

SRS WARNING LIGHT

When ignition switch is turned to ON position, SRS warning light will glow. If SRS faults are not detected, SRS warning light will go out after about 10 seconds or immediately after engine is started. If SRS detects a fault, warning light will remain on until fault is corrected and memory is cleared. If warning light fails to glow, bulb is faulty and/or a short exists in wire to bulb.

SEAT BELT TENSIONER

All models are equipped with pyrotechnical seat belt tensioners for driver and front passenger seats. If vehicle’s deceleration rate, recorded by crash sensor, is sufficiently high, crash sensor delivers voltage charges to activate gas generators in seat belt tensioners. If seat belt tensioner gas generator is activated by crash sensor, a quantity of non-toxic nitrogen gas is produced. This gas pressure displaces plunger mounted in tensioner tube and tightens seat belt by tensioning cable connected to seat belt reel. In a collision, seat belt tensioners tighten seat belts instantly, holding occupant tightly against seat back.

## SYSTEM OPERATION CHECK

Turn ignition switch to ON position (engine not running). If no fault codes are present, SRS warning light will go out after 10 seconds. If SRS is malfunctioning, SRS fault code will be stored in crash sensor memory during the following conditions:

-   SRS warning light does not glow.
    
-   SRS warning light does not go out after 10 seconds.
    
-   SRS warning light does not go out after engine is started.
    
-   SRS warning light comes on while driving.
    
    If SRS warning light indicates a malfunction, enter self- diagnostics and retrieve fault codes. See SELF-DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM under DIAGNOSIS & TESTING.
    
    Seat Belt Tensioner Inspection
    
    There are 2 methods of determining seat belt tensioner activation. Start by pulling seat belt out and releasing it. If belt normally extends easily to full length, tensioner has not been activated. If either belt sticks, jerks when reeling and unreeling or fails to reel, both belts must be replaced. If seat belt tensioner activation can not be determined, turn ignition switch to OFF position. Remove "B" post inner panel. Insert a steel rod into tensioner tube to establish position of plunger. If plunger position is near bottom of tensioner tube, seat belt tensioner has not deployed. If plunger position is near top of tensioner tube, seat belt tensioner has been activated and both belts must be replaced.
    
    ## SERVICE PRECAUTIONS
    
    Observe these precautions when working with air bag systems:
    
-   Always disable SRS before performing any air bag repairs. See DISABLING & ACTIVATING AIR BAG SYSTEM.
    
-   Always ensure radio is off before disconnecting battery. This
    
    will prevent damage to radio microprocessor.
    
-   Always wear safety glasses and gloves when handling a deployed air bag module and/or seat belt tensioners. Air bag module and/or seat belt tensioners may contain sodium hydroxide deposits, which irritate skin.
    
-   Use caution when handling sensors. Never strike or jar sensors.
    
    All sensors and mounting bracket bolts must be tightened carefully to ensure proper sensor operation. See TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS.
    
-   Never apply power to SRS if any SRS crash sensor is not securely mounted to vehicle.
    
-   Never make any measurement directly on air bag module(s) or seat belt tensioners. A fault in these components is determined by a process of elimination using Special Test Resistor (998 8695).
    
-   To avoid accidental air bag deployment when trouble shooting SRS, DO NOT use self-powered electrical test equipment, such as battery-powered or AC-powered voltmeter, ohmmeter, etc. when air bag module(s) or seat belt tensioners are connected to SRS.
    
-   When called for during diagnostics, use a DVOM with ohmmeter ranges of 2000 ohms and 200,000 ohms with a one-percent error tolerance.
    
-   Wiring repairs should not be performed on any portion of SRS wiring harness.
    
-   Always handle air bag modules with trim cover away from your body. Always place air bag module on workbench with trim cover facing up, away from loose objects.
    
    ## DISABLING & ACTIVATING AIR BAG SYSTEM
    
    WARNING: DO NOT disconnect crash sensor connector or standby power unit to disable system. This action could cause air bag to deploy.

## WIRE REPAIR

DO NOT attempt to repair SRS wiring or harness connectors. If SRS wiring or harness connectors are faulty, replace faulty wiring harness.

## DIAGNOSIS & TESTING

WARNING: Failure to follow SERVICE PRECAUTIONS may result in air bag deployment and personal injury. See SERVICE PRECAUTIONS.

NOTE: After component replacement, ensure proper system operation.

Perform SYSTEM OPERATION CHECK. DO NOT use ohmmeter or other self-powered meter to test resistance of air bag inflator/module or seat belt tensioner.

Use Special Test Resistor (998 8695) in place of air bag module(s) or seat belt tensioner when testing resistance of any SRS circuit. Special Test Resister (998 8695) specified resistance is 1.8-2.5 ohms, which is same as components it replaces. Test resistor can be "deployed" if deployment voltage is applied to it while connected to SRS. Ensure test resistor resistance is as specified after each use. If resistance is not as specified, replace test resistor.

SELF-DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM

On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) unit performs 2 tests, a start-up test and a cyclical test. During start-up test, microprocessors perform complete system diagnose. A fault will not be recorded until start-up test has been repeated one or 2 more times. Cyclical test is performed 4 times per second. A fault must be detected during 2 successive measurements before a fault will be stored. After fault has been detected for 10 seconds, it will be stored and SRS warning light will be turned on. When a fault(s) is detected, SRS warning light will remain on until fault(s) is corrected and faults are cleared from OBD.

A detected fault can occur internally within air bag module, seat belt tensioner, crash sensor or SRS wiring harnesses. A stored fault or faults will be displayed by a series of flashes from SRS warning light and/or LED light on section "A" of OBD unit located in engine compartment.

Flash codes consist of 3 digits or series of flashes. For example code 2-2-1 would be 2 flashes plus 2 flashes plus one flash. Only first 5 fault codes detected will be stored. These fault codes are stored in a non-volatile memory that will retain stored codes even if battery voltage is lost.

NOTE: If SRS warning light does not come on, go to SRS WARNING LIGHT PROBLEMS.

Retrieving Codes

1.  Turn ignition switch to OFF position. Locate On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) unit in engine compartment (left side). See Fig. 1.
    
2.  Connect OBD test lead from side "A" to socket No. B5 in side "B". See Fig. 10. Turn ignition switch to ON position and depress test button on side "A" once. Keep button depressed 0.5-3.0 seconds. LED will display first fault code. Continue depressing test button until all fault codes have been displayed and recorded. There must be at least 1.7 seconds between each flash code displayed.
    
3.  After recording all fault codes, turn ignition off. Turning ignition off will not clear codes. For fault code descriptions, See SRS FAULT CODES table.

Clearing Codes

1.  All fault codes must be displayed in order at least once before they can be cleared. Display of first code displayed, a second time, indicates all codes in memory have been displayed. Fault codes must be displayed during same ignition-on period before they can be cleared.
    
2.  Connect OBD test lead from side "A" to socket No. B5 in side "B". See Fig. 10. Turn ignition switch to ON position, and depress test button on side "A" once. Keep button depressed for at
    
    least 5 seconds. Release test button and LED will come on. While LED is on, depress test button and hold it for at least 5 seconds. Fault codes are now cleared.
    
3.  Verify that fault codes have been cleared by repeating retrieval steps. See RETRIEVING CODES. If fault codes have been properly cleared, fault code 1-1-1 will display. If another fault code(s) is displayed, record code(s) and repeat code retrieving procedures. Record these codes and repeat clearing procedures. See step 2). If fault codes are still present, correct faults and repeat clearing code procedures. To ensure SRS fault codes are now cleared, perform SYSTEM OPERATION CHECK.

        SRS WARNING LIGHT PROBLEMS
        
        NOTE: Some faults do not set codes. These faults must be located by measurement, interpreting secondary fault codes and eliminating other faults.
        
        SRS WARNING LIGHT WILL NOT COME ON
        
    -   Conditions For Fault(s):
        
        1.  Normally SRS warning light should come on when ignition is turned on. SRS warning light should go out after 10 seconds or when engine starts. Incorporated into the instrument gauge cluster circuit board is an indicating circuit that switches SRS warning light on and off. Voltage supplied to indicating circuit is controlled by crash sensor. When self-diagnostics are completed, crash sensor lowers supply voltage from 8.5 volts to 1.5 volts, causing SRS light to go out.
            
        2.  At this time voltage measured at alternator terminal "D+" will be zero volts with ignition off or in position "I", .8-2 volts with ignition in position II, and greater than 8 volts when engine is running.
            
    -   Fault Symptom(s) - SRS light does not come on when ignition is on, but flashes when fault codes are displayed. Fault codes can be read on OBD LED. SRS warning light does not come on.
        
    -   Fault Source(s) - Alternator (Red wire) terminal "D+" is shorted to supply. Defective SRS light. Incorrect voltage in instrument gauge cluster. Circuit between crash sensor and instrument gauge cluster shorted to ground (this will set fault code 1-2-7; see FAULT CODE TESTING). Crash sensor SRS light output defective (this will set fault codes 1-1-2 or
        
        1-2-7; see FAULT CODE TESTING)
        
    -   Corrective Action:
        

1.  Check circuit between alternator (Red wire) terminal "D+" and crash sensor connector terminal No. 19 for a short to battery voltage. Measure voltage between crash sensor connector terminal No.
    
    19 and ground. See Fig. 11. If voltage is less than 2 volts, short does not exist. If voltage is greater than 8 volts, SRS light circuit is shorted to battery voltage. Repair as necessary, clear fault codes and perform SYSTEM OPERATION CHECK to verify repair and recheck for fault codes.
    
2.  If fault code 1-1-2 is displayed, replace crash sensor, see FAULT CODE TESTING. Clear fault codes and perform SYSTEM OPERATION CHECK to verify repair and recheck for fault codes. If fault code 1-2-
    

1.  is displayed, see FAULT CODE TESTING. If fault code 1-1-1 is
    
    displayed, remove instrument panel cover, raise instrument gauge cluster and replace SRS warning light bulb. If SRS warning light bulb still not come on, replace printed circuit board in instrument gauge cluster. Clear fault codes and perform SYSTEM OPERATION CHECK to verify repair and recheck for fault codes.
    
    SRS WARNING LIGHT COMES ON, BUT FAULT CODE(S) DO NOT DISPLAY
    
    -   Conditions For Fault Code - None.
        
    -   Fault Symptom(s) - SRS warning light comes on, but only fault code 1-1-1 is displayed.
        
    -   Fault Source(s) - Open or short to ground in circuit between alternator terminal "D+" and crash sensor terminal No. 19. High/low supply voltage. Instrument gauge cluster fault. Open in circuit between crash sensor and instrument gauge cluster.
        
    -   Corrective Action:
        
        1.  Disconnect crash sensor connector. Start engine. Check circuit from alternator terminal "D+" to terminal No. 19 at crash sensor for an open or short. See Fig. 11. Ensure voltage is greater than 8 volts. If voltage is less than 8 volts, repair short or open in
            
            circuit. If voltage is greater than 8 volts, go to next step.
            
        2.  Start engine and measure voltage at terminal No. 15 of crash sensor connector. See Fig. 11. If voltage is greater than 9 volts, go to next step. If voltage is less than 9 volts, replace SRS warning light circuit in instrument gauge cluster. If voltage does not increase to greater than 9 volts after circuit replacement, replace crash sensor.
            
        3.  After repairs and/or component replacement, clear fault codes and perform SYSTEM OPERATION CHECK to verify repair and recheck for fault codes.
            
        
        ON-BOARD DIAGNOSTIC UNIT PROBLEMS
        
        LED DOES NOT COME ON
        
    -   Conditions For Fault Code - None.
        
    -   Fault Symptom(s) - LED on diagnostic unit does not come on.
        
    -   Fault Source(s) - Defective LED. No power supply to diagnostic unit. Diagnostic unit not grounded.
        
    -   Corrective Action:
        
        1.  Connect test lead from diagnostic unit side "A" to side "B" socket No. 5. See Fig. 10. Turn ignition switch to ON position. When test button on side "A" is depressed, LED should come on. If LED does not come on, go to next step and check power supply.
            
        2.  Turn ignition switch to ON position. Disconnect connector from underside of diagnostic unit side "A". Measure voltage between socket No. 4 and ground. If battery voltage is present, go to next step and check ground connection. If battery voltage is not present, check fuse No. 33 and associated wiring for an open.
            
        3.  Turn ignition switch to OFF position. With diagnostic unit side "A" connector disconnected, measure resistance between socket No.
            
2.  and ground. If resistance is zero ohms, replace diagnostic unit and repeat test. If resistance is greater than zero ohms, inspect ground terminal and circuit for an open.
    
    LED COMES ON, BUT NO CODES ARE DISPLAYED
    
    -   Conditions For Fault Code - Fault code 1-1-1 does not display indicating that no fault has been detected.
        
    -   Fault Symptom(s) - None.
        
    -   Fault Source(s) - Open or short between diagnostic unit test lead and crash sensor connector terminal No. 29. See Fig. 11. Crash sensor internal fault.
        
    -   Corrective Action:
        
        Turn ignition switch to ON position. Disconnect diagnostic unit test lead from side "B" socket No. 5. See Fig. 10. Measure voltage between socket No. 5 and ground. If voltage is approximately10 volts, replace diagnostic unit. If voltage is not approximately 10 volts, inspect circuit between crash sensor connector No. 29 and diagnostic unit side "B" socket No. 5 for an open or short to ground.
