Volvotips got exclusive permission of Volvo Cars Heritage to publish the Volvo 940 & 960 service manuals and Volvo 900-series parts catalogs. These service manuals and parts catalogs can be viewed at Volvotips but aren’t allowed to be downloaded. Instead of a downloadable PDF I created online Flash-version (sort of e-book) of all Volvo-manuals and catalogs which can be browsed through in your webbrowser. Some other repair manuals are a HTML-version.

To view the Volvo 900-series servicebooks and Volvo 940 greenbooks just click on the links below so you can watch them instantly! For using the service manual: press the < > buttons for previous/next page, + or – for zooming in and out and 1:1 for a normal size view. Please note: to view these repair manuals Adobe Flash is required, if you don’t have it [click here](http://www.adobe.com/ "Adobe Flash flashplayer is required to view the Volvo 240 service manual") to download and install it.

The Volvo 940 service and repair manual covers the following models:

-   Volvo 944 (4-door Volvo 940-series sedan with 4-cylinder redblock or 6-cylinder diesel engine)
-   Volvo 945 (5-door estate / stationwagon with 4-cylinder redblock or 6-cylinder diesel engine)

Using the Volvo service manual isn’t hard: just look for the subject described below (like the engine, bodywork or cooling system) and click on the link to open the service manual for that subject. At the index you can find at which page the information can be found where you’re looking for and scroll down to get to the right page.

Please keep in mind some of the service manuals are pretty large in filesize, so it can take a while before it’s completely downloaded.
