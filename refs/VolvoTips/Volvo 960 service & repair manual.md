        ## INTERMITTENTS
        
        INTERMITTENT PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS
        
        Intermittent fault testing requires duplicating circuit or component failure to identify the problem. These procedures may lead to the computer setting a fault code (on some systems) which may help in diagnosis.
        
        If problem vehicle does not produce fault codes, monitor voltage or resistance values using a DVOM while attempting to reproduce conditions causing intermittent fault. A status change on DVOM indicates a fault has been located.
        
        Use a DVOM to pinpoint faults. When monitoring voltage, ensure ignition switch is in ON position or engine is running. Ensure ignition switch is in OFF position or negative battery cable is disconnected when monitoring circuit resistance. Status changes on DVOM during test procedures indicate area of fault.
        
        TEST PROCEDURES
        
        Intermittent Simulation
        
        To reproduce conditions creating an intermittent fault:
        
    -   Lightly vibrate component.
        
    -   Heat component.
        
    -   Wiggle or bend wiring harnesses.
        
    -   Spray component with water mist.
        
    -   Remove/apply vacuum source.
        

Monitor circuit/component voltage or resistance while simulating intermittent. If engine is running, monitor for self-diagnostic codes. Use test results to identify a faulty component or circuit.
